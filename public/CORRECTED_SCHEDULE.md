# Corrected Schedule Recommendations

## Thursday 8:30am - What Pavel SHOULD Have Attended

### Original Assignment (What Happened):
- Pavel → Cash Transfers (Pavel score: 10, Max score: 100)
- **WRONG**: This was Max's session, not Pavel's

### Corrected Assignment (What Should Happen):
- **Pavel** → Medicare Policy in Action (Pavel score: 70)
- **Daphne** → Medicaid Dental Benefits (Daphne score: 95)
- **Cash Transfers** → Save for future conference or flag as "Max's session"

## Lesson for Scoring Algorithm:

Pavel's expertise is **quantitative microsimulation**, not qualitative policy discussions.

**Pavel HIGH scores:**
- Tax policy analysis (numbers/models)
- Microsimulation methodology
- Distributional analysis
- Administrative data applications
- Medicare/Medicaid when focused on program evaluation/data

**Pavel LOW scores:**
- Qualitative roundtables (unless about methods)
- General policy discussions without quantitative analysis
- Topic-specific sessions better suited to CEO perspective (cash transfers = Max's passion)

**Updated scoring now:**
- Cash Transfers roundtable: Pavel 10 → Redirects to Max (100)
- Medicare Policy evaluation: Pavel 70 → Good technical fit
- Tax credits with data: Pavel 95 → Perfect fit

This ensures Pavel attends sessions matching his technical microsimulation expertise, not general policy discussions better suited for Max's CEO/advocacy perspective.
