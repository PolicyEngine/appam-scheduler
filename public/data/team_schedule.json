This panel presents four empirical studies that examine: how individuals with new high-need diagnoses navigate plan choices; how expanded eligibility under the Cures Act has shifted the Medicare Advantage (MA) landscape for ESKD patients; how the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s insulin copay cap has affected access and outcomes; and how Medicare Coverage shapes Treatment of Opioid use disorder. Together, these studies reveal how policy design and beneficiary response shape care for complex populations.",

        "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 5th Floor, 512 - WillapaSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractPolicymakers have long recognized the potential for schools to provide early identification and management of youth health issues. Policies such as the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), the 2014 free care policy reversal, and federal grants have directed more funding to bring more mental health personnel into schools. Medicaid reimbursement for services provided to students is one strategy schools can use to fund and retain mental health professionals, and to that end, the BSCA called for an update by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to the rules that determine what is eligible for reimbursement and how schools can submit for Medicaid reimbursement. Before the 2014 free care policy reversal, schools could not receive Medicaid reimbursement for services unless they were provided via an Individualized Educational Program. Since then, states have the option of expanding Medicaid to take advantage of reimbursement for services provided to any Medicaid-enrolled student. To encourage more states to support reimbursement of school-based health services, the new CMS guide strives to decrease administrative burdens on schools and develop easier methods for requesting reimbursement. Altogether, these are important policy changes to understand and investigate the extent to which they are increasing the presence of health professionals in schools and the receipt of Medicaid-funded school-based health services by children.",

        "title": "Access and Retention in SNAP and WIC: Patterns and Interventions",
        "location": "Grand Hyatt Seattle, 1st Floor/Lobby Level, Princess 1Session Submission Type: PanelAbstractMuch of public benefit attainment in programs like SNAP and WIC relates to administrative processes and associated burdens, and many studies take as their premise that addressing these administrative barriers can increase benefit access and retention (Herd & Moynihan, 2018; Giannella et al, 2024; Wu & Meyer, 2021). In a policy environment with substantial devolution in programs like TANF and the potential for future devolution in others (Bruch et al, 2018), understanding patterns of benefit access and retention on a state-by-state level may inform how to make these programs more effective and resilient. Recent research demonstrates that increases in state-level administrative discretion have indeed increased differences in benefit attainment (Herd & Moynihan 2023). This panel brings together state-level analyses of SNAP and WIC cases using administrative data to understand how different elements of program administration impact access and retention, particularly in ways that may impact existing disparities. The first paper, by Basurto et al., studies SNAP take-up differences based on state adoption of online applications. The second paper, by Fox-Dichter et al., describes patterns of churn in the New Jersey SNAP caseload, examining characteristics of the cases most likely to miss four or fewer months of benefits within a few years of SNAP versus those that stayed on SNAP for the duration of that time frame. The third paper, by Bitler et al., examines WIC retention and whether the transition to WIC EBT on the county level impacted recertification in a mountain state. Taken together, these papers will provide insights into how local-level differences and discretion in program administration may impact participants\u2019 access and retention of benefits, identifying opportunities for future state- and local-level improvement, and how states can make use of administrative data as well as online discourse for program learning and improvement.Policy AreaPoverty and Income PolicySecondary Policy AreaSocial Equity and RaceChairAndrea Hetling, Rutgers University - New BrunswickDiscussantsLaura Peck, Rutgers UniversitySwati S Joshi, University of Wisconsin-MadisonOrganizerSophia Fox-Dichter, Rutgers University - New BrunswickIndividual PresentationsThe Role of Technology in the Safety Net: Adoption of Online SNAP Applications - Presenting Author:  Luis E Basurto, Cornell UniversityPatterns of Churn in New Jersey's SNAP Caseload - Presenting Author:  Sophia Fox-Dichter, Rutgers University - New Brunswick; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Andrea Hetling, Rutgers University - New Brunswick; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Kirsten Meidlinger, Rutgers University - New BrunswickEffects of EBT on Program Enrollment: Evidence from a Mountain State - Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Marianne Bitler, University of California, Davis; Presenting Author:  Caitlin Shamoly Dutta, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Seojung Oh, University of North Carolina, Charlotte; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Jason B Cook \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

        "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 6th Floor, 601 - HohSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractThis panel examines how policymakers and researchers can better understand, evaluate, and improve the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and related social safety net policies. Using diverse analytical approaches, including quasi-experimental methods, large-scale survey data, and analyses of user-generated online content, the three papers offer new evidence and tools for addressing the challenges of food insecurity, program design, and administrative burden.The first paper examines the impact of SNAP Emergency Allotment (EA) expiration on food insufficiency among households with children, highlighting vulnerable subgroups disproportionately affected by benefit cuts. The second paper utilizes user-generated content on Reddit to explore the lived experiences of SNAP applicants and beneficiaries, providing real-time insights into administrative burdens and procedural challenges. The third paper investigates the expansion of online grocery purchasing for SNAP and related food assistance programs, showing that greater access to digital transactions enhances program use and reduces redemption barriers.Collectively, these presentations highlight the evolving nature of SNAP and its central role in the U.S. safety net. The panel underscores the importance of designing programs that are effective and equitable, while also responsive to the economic, technological, and administrative realities faced by low-income households, grounded in structured policy analysis, empirical evidence, and lived experience.Policy AreaPoverty and Income PolicySecondary Policy AreaPolitics, Media, and the Policy ProcessChairMichele Ver Ploeg, George Washington UniversityDiscussantsEllyn Terry, University of WashingtonLiwei Zhang, The University of GeorgiaOrganizerElora Choudhury, University of Michigan Ann ArborIndividual PresentationsFood Insufficiency After SNAP Emergency Allotment Expiration: Evidence from Households with Children - Presenting Author:  Ruijie Ma, University of PittsburghUnderstanding Administrative Burdens and Experiences of Social Program Beneficiaries and Applicants Using Posts on Reddit - Presenting Author:  Michiko Ueda, Syracuse University; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Colleen M Heflin, Syracuse UniversityFrom Storefronts to Screens: The Impacts of Online Grocery Shopping on Public Food Assistance Users - Presenting Author:  Kelsey Pukelis, Harvard University & California Department of Social Services \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

        "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 5th Floor, 501 - ChiwawaSession Submission Type: Late-Breaking RoundtableAbstractCongress passed H.R. 1 (also known as the \u201cOne Bill Beautiful Bill\u201d) on July 4, 2025. H.R. 1 expanded work requirements for those enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and instituted work requirements for the first time in Medicaid. By at least January 2027, work requirements will be imposed on Medicaid expansion adult enrollees 19 to 64. Starting this year, SNAP work requirements are expanding to those ages 55 to 65 and to participants responsible for caring for a dependent child aged 14 and above. The law also requires that states with higher SNAP error rates share the cost of benefits and reduces eligibility for certain noncitizens.As state agencies move toward operational changes, there are opportunities to better use current data systems to support HR1 compliance and exemption and mitigate negative impacts on Medicaid and SNAP enrollment. Through automated verification using \u2018ex-parte\u2019 processes and automated exemption for the medically frail, states could leverage already-existing data and systems to reduce the administrative burdens that their eligible populations must overcome to retain coverage. This roundtable will examine the evidence for how H.R. 1 is likely to impact SNAP and Medicaid by bringing together representatives from academia and two state agencies in Washington State to directly grapple with these challenges.The roundtable will address the following questions:What lessons can policymakers, researchers, and advocates draw from previous research and early efforts to respond to H.R. 1?How are states interpreting and planning to implement the new requirements?And what strategies are being used to reduce administrative burdens, ensure compliance, and mitigate potential coverage losses?Jeremy Barofsky (Associate Research Professor, Georgetown University, McCourt School of Public Policy, Better Government Lab) will serve as the roundtable moderator and provide policy background to ground the discussion, drawing on evidence from previous efforts to implement Medicaid work requirements and improvements in automated verification processes rolled out during Medicaid unwinding. Eric Giannella (Associate Research Professor, Georgetown University, McCourt School of Public Policy, Better Government Lab) will provide background on evidence on changes to SNAP, including the expansion of work requirements and SNAP error rates changes. We will have representatives from Washington State that will address their state\u2019s early responses to H.R. 1 in both Medicaid and SNAP. Trinity Wilson (Director of Medicaid Eligibility and Customer Service, Washington State Health Care Authority) and Carla Reyes (Assistant Secretary, Economic Services Administration) will explain how Washington State is preparing for changes to Medicaid and SNAP, respectively, and how these programs intend to work together. The roundtable will conclude by inviting audience members to participate and ask questions.Policy AreaPublic and Nonprofit Management and FinanceSecondary Policy AreaPoverty and Income PolicyModeratorJeremy Barofsky, Georgetown UniversityOrganizerJeremy Barofsky, Georgetown UniversitySpeakersEric Giannella, Georgetown UniversityCarla Reyes, Washington State Department of Social and Health ServicesTrinity Wilson, WA State Healthcare Authority \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",
