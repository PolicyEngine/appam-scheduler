H.R. 1 expanded work requirements for those enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and instituted work requirements for the first time in Medicaid. By at least January 2027, work requirements will be imposed on Medicaid expansion adult enrollees 19 to 64. Starting this year, SNAP work requirements are expanding to those ages 55 to 65 and to participants responsible for caring for a dependent child aged 14 and above. The law also requires that states with higher SNAP error rates share the cost of benefits and reduces eligibility for certain noncitizens.As state agencies move toward operational changes, there are opportunities to better use current data systems to support HR1 compliance and exemption and mitigate negative impacts on Medicaid and SNAP enrollment. Through automated verification using \u2018ex-parte\u2019 processes and automated exemption for the medically frail, states could leverage already-existing data and systems to reduce the administrative burdens that their eligible populations must overcome to retain coverage. This roundtable will examine the evidence for how H.R. 1 is likely to impact SNAP and Medicaid by bringing together representatives from academia and two state agencies in Washington State to directly grapple with these challenges.The roundtable will address the following questions:What lessons can policymakers, researchers, and advocates draw from previous research and early efforts to respond to H.R. 1?How are states interpreting and planning to implement the new requirements?And what strategies are being used to reduce administrative burdens, ensure compliance, and mitigate potential coverage losses?Jeremy Barofsky (Associate Research Professor, Georgetown University, McCourt School of Public Policy, Better Government Lab) will serve as the roundtable moderator and provide policy background to ground the discussion, drawing on evidence from previous efforts to implement Medicaid work requirements and improvements in automated verification processes rolled out during Medicaid unwinding. Eric Giannella (Associate Research Professor, Georgetown University, McCourt School of Public Policy, Better Government Lab) will provide background on evidence on changes to SNAP, including the expansion of work requirements and SNAP error rates changes. We will have representatives from Washington State that will address their state\u2019s early responses to H.R. 1 in both Medicaid and SNAP. Trinity Wilson (Director of Medicaid Eligibility and Customer Service, Washington State Health Care Authority) and Carla Reyes (Assistant Secretary, Economic Services Administration) will explain how Washington State is preparing for changes to Medicaid and SNAP, respectively, and how these programs intend to work together. The roundtable will conclude by inviting audience members to participate and ask questions.Policy AreaPublic and Nonprofit Management and FinanceSecondary Policy AreaPoverty and Income PolicyModeratorJeremy Barofsky, Georgetown UniversityOrganizerJeremy Barofsky, Georgetown UniversitySpeakersEric Giannella, Georgetown UniversityCarla Reyes, Washington State Department of Social and Health ServicesTrinity Wilson, WA State Healthcare Authority \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

Colleges and states are pursuing varying approaches to address student basic needs such as food pantries and emergency aid (e.g., California Community College Chancellor\u2019s Office, 2024; Hodara et al., 2023; Nix et al., 2023). Some college and state efforts have focused on increasing student access to public benefit programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid (e.g., Burnside, Gilkesson, and Baker, 2021; Duke-Benfield and Davis, 2024; Ladkau and Ward, 2022; Loofbourrow and Scherr, 2023; Swipe Out Hunger, 2024).

      "location": "Grand Hyatt Seattle, 1st Floor/Lobby Level, Portland BSession Submission Type: RoundtableAbstractEvaluating child welfare programs and services requires cooperation and coordination with agency administrators, program managers, and front-line workers. The evaluation can require staff to conduct additional activities, organize their work differently from their normal procedures, and involve connections with other agencies not involved with the particular program or service. Most of these challenges can be overcome when agencies feel committed to understanding whether a program or service \u201cworks\u201d and when researchers design and resource their evaluation to meet the needs of the agency. This roundtable brings together researchers who have experience working with child welfare agencies and service providers to conduct rigorous program evaluations, and agency staff who have experienced evaluations from the \u201cinside.\u201d The researchers will discuss key challenges they have observed when considering evaluations involving child welfare agencies such as (1) agencies don\u2019t typically plan for the resources required for evaluations; (2) staff burden is significant; (3) data sharing requires substantial resources and collaboration within and across agencies; (4) timelines for sharing results back with agencies are long; and (5) resistance to randomized control trials (RCTs) and rigorous quasi-experimental designs (QEDs) is common. Next, agency staff will share their reactions and thoughts about the challenges identified by the researchers as well as their own experiences of contending with competing demands, altering established procedures, creating tracking systems, and sharing data across agencies and with evaluators. They will also describe the factors that influenced their agency\u2019s willingness and ability to undergo a rigorous program evaluation (e.g., input into study design, resources to support the randomization and data sharing process, commitment to evidence-driven decision making). Panelists will provide specific examples of evaluations that reflect a diverse set of programs and contexts, including an evaluation of a program for transition age youth in New Jersey; one on New Jersey\u2019s Keeping Families Together program, which provides housing vouchers and services to families in the child welfare system; an evaluation of an intensive, in-home clinical treatment program in Connecticut for families with children (birth to 5 years old inclusive) who are at risk for abuse and/or neglect, poor developmental outcomes and removal from their home due to parental substance use; an Connecticut program serving families using the Multi Dimensional Family Treatment and Recovery Model for adult caregivers that have substance use concerns and are pregnant or have a child 0-5; and an evaluation of HUD\u2019s Family Unification Program (FUP), which provides housing choice vouchers to families in the child welfare system. Finally, panelists will engage session participants in a facilitated, interactive discussion about solutions that can support rigorous evaluation while minimizing the imposition on the agency, and considerations for determining whether a particular program and agency are well suited for implementation of a RCT or QED.Policy AreaFamily and Child PolicyModeratorBridgette Lery, Urban InstituteOrganizerMichael Pergamit, Urban InstituteSpeakersPamela Lilleston, State of New JerseyMark Courtney, University of ChicagoShannon Michelle Quinn, Washington State Department of Children, Youth & Families \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",
