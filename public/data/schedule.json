Although rural areas of the US have many issues that look the same as issues in urban areas (poverty, housing shortage, workforce shortage, childcare shortage), quite often the solutions must be approached in a different way. The distances and population sparsity of rural areas have a major impact on economies of scale, which in turn affects how policy around these issues must be implemented and the cost of policy implementation. However, because of the wide range of socioeconomic and demographic differences around the country, rural itself can look very different from state to state or even within a state. This gathering would be an opportunity for rural policy professionals from different parts of the country to discuss issues and for those who are simply interested, to learn more about rural issues. Points of discussion could include but are not limited to:",

The report, and roundtable presentation, not only review the state of the current policy literature, but also present new microsimulation results supporting an assessment of both the 2021 policy changes (CTC, EITC, and other pandemic proposals), and a large set of alternative policy proposals. \u00a0The Roundtable will include short presentations highlighting the key conclusions of the NAS Committee, with substantial time for discussion of the policy implications given current (as of November 2025) tax policy discussions, and implications for policy implementation and research.",

Which policy interventions are effective at reducing it? Has the United States made progress in curbing intergenerational poverty in recent decades, and what explains any variation over time? How does the U.S. compare with other high-income countries? In his Kershaw Lecture, Parolin addresses these questions and more.

In contrast to public housing and other federally-subsidized project-based programs, LIHTC properties are built in partnership with private developers, who receive tax credits in exchange for building housing affordable to low-income families. The private-public partnership aspect of the program has implications for who lives in LIHTC and where LIHTC is located. The papers in this panel bring new perspectives and data sources to understand the broader implications of LIHTC development on local contexts, residential mobility patterns, and LIHTC tenants.",

      "location": "Grand Hyatt Seattle, 1st Floor/Lobby Level, Princess 1Session Submission Type: PanelAbstractMuch of public benefit attainment in programs like SNAP and WIC relates to administrative processes and associated burdens, and many studies take as their premise that addressing these administrative barriers can increase benefit access and retention (Herd & Moynihan, 2018; Giannella et al, 2024; Wu & Meyer, 2021). In a policy environment with substantial devolution in programs like TANF and the potential for future devolution in others (Bruch et al, 2018), understanding patterns of benefit access and retention on a state-by-state level may inform how to make these programs more effective and resilient. Recent research demonstrates that increases in state-level administrative discretion have indeed increased differences in benefit attainment (Herd & Moynihan 2023). This panel brings together state-level analyses of SNAP and WIC cases using administrative data to understand how different elements of program administration impact access and retention, particularly in ways that may impact existing disparities. The first paper, by Basurto et al., studies SNAP take-up differences based on state adoption of online applications. The second paper, by Fox-Dichter et al., describes patterns of churn in the New Jersey SNAP caseload, examining characteristics of the cases most likely to miss four or fewer months of benefits within a few years of SNAP versus those that stayed on SNAP for the duration of that time frame. The third paper, by Bitler et al., examines WIC retention and whether the transition to WIC EBT on the county level impacted recertification in a mountain state. Taken together, these papers will provide insights into how local-level differences and discretion in program administration may impact participants\u2019 access and retention of benefits, identifying opportunities for future state- and local-level improvement, and how states can make use of administrative data as well as online discourse for program learning and improvement.Policy AreaPoverty and Income PolicySecondary Policy AreaSocial Equity and RaceChairAndrea Hetling, Rutgers University - New BrunswickDiscussantsLaura Peck, Rutgers UniversitySwati S Joshi, University of Wisconsin-MadisonOrganizerSophia Fox-Dichter, Rutgers University - New BrunswickIndividual PresentationsThe Role of Technology in the Safety Net: Adoption of Online SNAP Applications - Presenting Author:  Luis E Basurto, Cornell UniversityPatterns of Churn in New Jersey's SNAP Caseload - Presenting Author:  Sophia Fox-Dichter, Rutgers University - New Brunswick; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Andrea Hetling, Rutgers University - New Brunswick; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Kirsten Meidlinger, Rutgers University - New BrunswickEffects of EBT on Program Enrollment: Evidence from a Mountain State - Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Marianne Bitler, University of California, Davis; Presenting Author:  Caitlin Shamoly Dutta, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Seojung Oh, University of North Carolina, Charlotte; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Jason B Cook \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

WIC provides supplemental foods, nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and health care and social services referrals to over 6.5 million low-income women, infants, and children each month. Over the past decade, WIC state agencies have implemented policy changes that affect program operations. These changes stem from federal waivers that facilitated program participation during the COVID-19 pandemic and from a federal requirement that all WIC state agencies transition from paper vouchers to an electronic benefits transfer system for WIC benefit redemption. The papers in this panel evaluate these WIC policy changes from multidisciplinary perspectives, including public health, economics, and policy fields.",

Public service is understood not just as designing policies or performing administrative tasks; it is fundamentally about promoting collective well-being and upholding the principles of social equity, justice, and inclusion. This gathering aims to create a community of practice that brings together practitioners, scholars, and students of public policy and administration who are committed to (and/or curious to learn more about) advancing social equity and justice through trauma-informed, repair- and healing-focused approaches. The intention is to foster a space for community building, sharing reflections on rewards, challenges, and opportunities, exchanging ideas, innovations, and promising strategies aimed at developing a trauma-informed, repair-and-healing-oriented public service in service of deeper social equity and justice-focused change. We will explore ideas and innovative approaches within public policy and administrative practices that seek to transform conditions of inequality, break cycles of harm and oppression, and promote community-led alternatives and solutions guided by those most affected by inequities.\u00a0Policy AreaAPPAM CommunitiesOrganizerRashmi Vijay Chordiya, Seattle UniversitySpeakersRashmi Vijay Chordiya, Seattle UniversityMeghna Sabharwal, University of Texas, DallasAdana Protonentis, Kindred Leadership Consulting \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

Using diverse analytical approaches, including quasi-experimental methods, large-scale survey data, and analyses of user-generated online content, the three papers offer new evidence and tools for addressing the challenges of food insecurity, program design, and administrative burden.The first paper examines the impact of SNAP Emergency Allotment (EA) expiration on food insufficiency among households with children, highlighting vulnerable subgroups disproportionately affected by benefit cuts. The second paper utilizes user-generated content on Reddit to explore the lived experiences of SNAP applicants and beneficiaries, providing real-time insights into administrative burdens and procedural challenges. The third paper investigates the expansion of online grocery purchasing for SNAP and related food assistance programs, showing that greater access to digital transactions enhances program use and reduces redemption barriers.Collectively, these presentations highlight the evolving nature of SNAP and its central role in the U.S. safety net. The panel underscores the importance of designing programs that are effective and equitable, while also responsive to the economic, technological, and administrative realities faced by low-income households, grounded in structured policy analysis, empirical evidence, and lived experience.Policy AreaPoverty and Income PolicySecondary Policy AreaPolitics, Media, and the Policy ProcessChairMichele Ver Ploeg, George Washington UniversityDiscussantsEllyn Terry, University of WashingtonLiwei Zhang, The University of GeorgiaOrganizerElora Choudhury, University of Michigan Ann ArborIndividual PresentationsFood Insufficiency After SNAP Emergency Allotment Expiration: Evidence from Households with Children - Presenting Author:  Ruijie Ma, University of PittsburghUnderstanding Administrative Burdens and Experiences of Social Program Beneficiaries and Applicants Using Posts on Reddit - Presenting Author:  Michiko Ueda, Syracuse University; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Colleen M Heflin, Syracuse UniversityFrom Storefronts to Screens: The Impacts of Online Grocery Shopping on Public Food Assistance Users - Presenting Author:  Kelsey Pukelis, Harvard University & California Department of Social Services \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

These policies have not only gained national attention, they have been the subject of several successful collaborative research partnerships between city policymakers and academic researchers. This roundtable includes three researchers who have worked with the City of Seattle to ensure that its policies are rigorously evaluated and that the evidence produced is effectively translated to policymakers, community organizations, and residents. It will also include a City of Seattle policymaker, Robyn Kumar, Fresh Bucks program manager, who has experience working collaboratively with researchers and who can provide her perspective as a consumer and interpreter of academic research findings when designing effective and equitable policies.The three academic panelists have years of experience working with local government to design program evaluations that address both policymakers' interests and answer questions relevant to the academic literature. All three have been PIs on multiple funded evaluations of these policies, with funding coming from the City of Seattle, the National Institutes of Health, and various philanthropic foundations.\u00a0Some topics of discussion will be: Designing research that policymakers will find useful and that can be translated into policy improvements; Working with policymakers and community members to interpret research findings; Securing local government or external funding for policy evaluations; Responding to changes in the policy environment while maintaining planned research goals; Challenges of working closely with policymakers.Policy AreaPoverty and Income PolicySecondary Policy AreaPolitics, Media, and the Policy ProcessModeratorHeather D Hill, University of WashingtonOrganizerMelissa Knox, University of WashingtonSpeakersJessica C Jones-Smith, University of California, IrvineJennie Romich, University of WashingtonMelissa Knox, University of WashingtonRobyn Kumar, City of Seattle, Office of Sustainability & Environment \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

Policies such as the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), the 2014 free care policy reversal, and federal grants have directed more funding to bring more mental health personnel into schools. Medicaid reimbursement for services provided to students is one strategy schools can use to fund and retain mental health professionals, and to that end, the BSCA called for an update by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to the rules that determine what is eligible for reimbursement and how schools can submit for Medicaid reimbursement. Before the 2014 free care policy reversal, schools could not receive Medicaid reimbursement for services unless they were provided via an Individualized Educational Program. Since then, states have the option of expanding Medicaid to take advantage of reimbursement for services provided to any Medicaid-enrolled student. To encourage more states to support reimbursement of school-based health services, the new CMS guide strives to decrease administrative burdens on schools and develop easier methods for requesting reimbursement. Altogether, these are important policy changes to understand and investigate the extent to which they are increasing the presence of health professionals in schools and the receipt of Medicaid-funded school-based health services by children.",

Colleges and states are pursuing varying approaches to address student basic needs such as food pantries and emergency aid (e.g., California Community College Chancellor\u2019s Office, 2024; Hodara et al., 2023; Nix et al., 2023). Some college and state efforts have focused on increasing student access to public benefit programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid (e.g., Burnside, Gilkesson, and Baker, 2021; Duke-Benfield and Davis, 2024; Ladkau and Ward, 2022; Loofbourrow and Scherr, 2023; Swipe Out Hunger, 2024). College students face barriers to accessing programs like SNAP due to complex eligibility requirements and administrative processes (Larin, 2024).State and college outreach and application support efforts aim to help college students to navigate these processes and access additional benefits to address student basic needs and minimize barriers to academic success.",

Most vision loss can be corrected with an up-to-date prescription for corrective lenses, but many adults do not have routine vision coverage. In a recent KFF poll, one-quarter of adults reported delaying or going without vision services due to cost.Routine eye exams and glasses are an optional adult benefit in state Medicaid programs. Previous research demonstrates that when states provide these benefits, Medicaid-enrolled adults are more likely to visit the eye doctor and experience improvements in vision. However, literature to date has focused on younger adults under age 65 without dual Medicare enrollment and has largely remained silent on health outcomes beyond vision. Moreover,\u00a0there is no comprehensive longitudinal database describing state-level routine vision benefits. The lack of reliable state-by-year level data limits research on the effect of vision benefits on outcomes and the role that vision benefits play as a financial lever that is used by states to manage their Medicaid programs.In this session, we present new evidence on the association between Medicaid routine vision benefits and health outcomes among dual Medicare and Medicaid enrolled adults. We examine the association between North Carolina's January 2019 addition of routine eye exams and glasses coverage and fall-related inpatient and emergency department discharges. We also examine the association between routine vision benefits and eye care access, out-of-pocket spending, and recent diagnoses of systemic health problems that can be identified durign an eye exam using national data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. Finally, we present a new longitudinal policy database that documents state-level policies from 2000-2023 and highlight its features in an application to the National Health Interview Survey.Policy AreaHealth PolicyChairAja Kennedy, Tufts UniversityDiscussantXuechao (Jane) Qian, Ball State UniversityOrganizerBrandy Lipton, University of California IrvineIndividual PresentationsImpacts of Medicaid Vision Coverage on Eye Care Use, Out-of-Pocket Spending, and Diagnoses Among Duals - Presenting Author:  Brandy Lipton, University of California IrvineA Longitudinal Database of Medicaid Routine Vision Coverage Policies, 2000-2023 - Presenting Author:  Michel H.

The first paper discusses how improved local access to mental health facilities leads to a reduction in mortality rates associated with mental health and behavioral disorders. The paper estimates indicate that a 10% increase in facilities lowers a county's mental health and behavioral disorders rate by 2%.The second paper examines the effects of hospital closures on the financial performance of nearby hospitals, differentiating outcomes based on ownership type. Tracking over 5,000 hospitals nationwide from 2011 to 2019, the study finds that for-profit neighboring hospitals capitalize on reduced competition by increasing their charge-to-cost ratios by nearly 200% and net profit margins by 6.1%, reflecting a profit-maximizing strategy. Nonprofit hospitals also experience financial benefits, though to a lesser extent, while governmental hospitals show minimal or negative financial impacts.The third paper analyzes trends in CEO compensation across nonprofit and for-profit healthcare systems. By utilizing compensation data from the nonprofit hospital Form 990s and proxy statements from publicly traded for-profit health systems, the study reveals that base salaries for the largest for-profit systems increased by 2.6%, while base salaries for a matched sample of nonprofit systems grew by 15.1%.Policy AreaHealth PolicySecondary Policy AreaMethods and Tools of AnalysisDiscussantAshley Bradford, Georgia Institute of TechnologyOrganizerSalpy Kanimian, Rice UniversityIndividual PresentationsHealth Effects of Local and Geographic Access to Mental Health Treatment Facilities - Presenting Author:  Olanrewaju Yusuff, Georgia State UniversityRipple Effects: The Impact of Neighboring Hospital Closures on Charges and Profitability Across Ownership Types - Presenting Author:  Salpy Kanimian, Rice UniversityCompensation for Hospital CEOs: Trends and Incentive Structures in Nonprofit vs. For-Profit Systems - Presenting Author:  Derek Jenkins, Rice UniversityThe Growth in Stand Alone Emergency Departments in Texas and their Impact on Hospital Operations - Presenting Author:  Benjamin Ukert, Texas A&M University \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",
