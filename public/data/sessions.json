The papers study the multigenerational health impacts of early-life exposure to legalized abortion, the effects of changes in abortion access during the era of targeted restrictions of abortion providers (TRAP laws), the impact of federal abortion funding bans on fertility and mortality, and the impact of clinical closures from TRAP laws and funding cuts in Texas on economic hardship and crime.

Yet, the equity implications of school fiscal and physical resources (or constraints) may vary widely across districts and schools. This panel brings together four empirical studies that examine the fiscal and equity impacts of education finance policies and mechanisms, including a school funding equalization reform, tax increment financing (TIF), shared school facilities, and capital outlay surtaxes. By examining datasets across multiple states, districts, and schools, these studies provide insights into both intended and unintended consequences and policy trade-offs associated with education finance decisions.",

For example, interventions targeting drunk driving aim to reduce drunk driving behavior in addition to DUI arrests and accidents. Similarly, substance use diversion programs aim to reduce substance use disorder and overdoses through connections to treatment, in addition to reducing subsequent arrests for drug use or sales. Historically, measuring these non-criminal justice outcomes required access to data that was very difficult to achieve, limiting the field\u2019s knowledge of how these interventions affect some of the primary outcomes they intend to influence. The four papers that comprise this panel all use novel administrative data to overcome these issues and provide insights into the impacts of a diverse set of criminal justice interventions, including mental health first response, police drug diversion, felony diversion at prosecution, and transmission interlock devices, on health, mental health, housing, and substance use outcomes.",

This panel brings together four studies that use rigorous empirical methods to evaluate the effectiveness of education policies and institutional practices designed to improve college access, persistence, and long-term outcomes for historically underserved populations. Taken together, these papers offer transformative and resilient policy solutions grounded in collaborative, data-driven approaches to system improvement.The first paper evaluates\u00a0Hope Chicago, a two-generation college pipeline program offering comprehensive financial, advising, and academic support to high school students and their parents in underinvested Chicago communities. By leveraging administrative data and a difference-in-differences design, the study demonstrates how multi-stakeholder partnerships\u2014between nonprofits, public schools, and postsecondary institutions\u2014can expand college access and success for first-generation students and families.The second paper assesses the\u00a0Star Scholarship, a free community college program for academically qualified students in Chicago. Employing a regression discontinuity design, the study finds that while the program shifts some students from four-year to two-year institutions, it increases overall degree attainment without lowering bachelor\u2019s degree completion. The findings reveal both the promise and complexity of financial aid design in shaping equitable college pathways\u2014particularly for immigrant and first-generation students\u2014and point to the importance of tailoring aid policies to local needs and student populations.The third paper takes a long-run, systemic view of educational equity by documenting a century of change in the economic returns to college for low-income students. The analysis shows that the equitable wage premium associated with college has steadily eroded due to shifts in institutional quality, sector representation, and major selection. These findings underscore the importance of understanding how macro-level changes in the structure of postsecondary education mediate intergenerational inequality.The final paper proposes a scalable method for estimating postsecondary instructor value-added, addressing a critical gap in how institutions evaluate teaching effectiveness. Using data from Indiana and Texas, the study shows that instructors have a substantial causal impact on student achievement and labor market outcomes\u2014effects that are not captured by conventional student evaluations. The results offer a path forward for institutions to align personnel decisions with long-term student success, especially for students at public universities.Together, these papers underscore the importance of multi-level partnerships\u2014between schools, colleges, communities, and researchers\u2014in developing policy solutions that are both transformative and resilient. They highlight how collaborative, evidence-based strategies can target persistent disparities and help shape a more equitable and effective higher education system.Policy AreaEducationChairPaco Martorell, University of California, DavisDiscussantsMichael Stephens Kofoed, University of Tennessee (Knoxville)Jiee Zhong, Miami UniversityOrganizerAnthony Yim, Brigham Young UniversityIndividual PresentationsImpact of Free Community College: Evidence From Chicago - Presenting Author:  Emileigh Harrison, The University of Texas at Austin; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Kelly Hallberg, University of ChicagoInstructor Value-Added in Postsecondary Education - Presenting Author:  Anthony Yim, Brigham Young UniversityChanges in the College Mobility Pipeline Since 1900 - Presenting Author:  Zachary Bleemer, Princeton UniversityEffects of a Two-Generation College Pipeline Program on Postsecondary Aspirations, Enrollment, and Completion - Presenting Author:  Lesley J.

This panel brings together interdisciplinary research that examines how policy design, healthcare delivery models, and socioeconomic factors shape maternal and infant health outcomes in the United States. In the context of persistent disparities and evolving health needs, each paper offers rigorous empirical evidence with direct implications for designing and improving health policy at all levels of government. The first paper investigates the effects of Tobacco 21 laws on prenatal smoking and birth outcomes using national data and quasi-experimental methods. The findings suggest a limited impact of these laws on maternal behavior, highlighting the need for more comprehensive, multi-level health policy interventions. The second paper explores how childcare costs influence fertility decisions, revealing that higher prices reduce birth rates and delay parenthood. These results emphasize the importance of cross-sector health and social policies that alleviate economic pressures on families, supporting maternal well-being and long-term population health. The third paper focuses on integrating early relational health (ERH) interventions into pediatric primary care. Drawing on a nationwide survey and qualitative data, it proposes a best practices toolkit to guide implementation and sustain effective programs. This work illustrates how health systems can collaborate with practitioners to improve early childhood development and family health. The final paper evaluates the impact of telehealth expansions during the COVID-19 pandemic on prenatal care utilization and birth outcomes. While telehealth increased care access, especially for fully treated pregnancies, it did not yield equivalent improvements across racial and ethnic groups\u2014underscoring the need for more equitable, inclusive health technology policies. Collectively, these studies demonstrate how collaborative, evidence-based approaches can strengthen maternal and infant health policy.

These programs provide pathways for students to earn industry-based certifications (IBCs), college credits, and non-cognitive skills essential for achieving successful life outcomes. However, the effectiveness of these programs depends significantly on their alignment with labor market demands and the educational contexts in which they are delivered. Policymakers continue to face challenges in optimizing program design, resource allocation, and ensuring equitable access and outcomes for various student populations. This panel features studies using robust administrative data to examine the efficacy and impacts of CTE, dual credit coursework, and credentialing policies, aiming to provide evidence to policymakers and stakeholders regarding best ways to support students\u2019 post-high school trajectories.",

These policies have not only gained national attention, they have been the subject of several successful collaborative research partnerships between city policymakers and academic researchers. This roundtable includes three researchers who have worked with the City of Seattle to ensure that its policies are rigorously evaluated and that the evidence produced is effectively translated to policymakers, community organizations, and residents. It will also include a City of Seattle policymaker, Robyn Kumar, Fresh Bucks program manager, who has experience working collaboratively with researchers and who can provide her perspective as a consumer and interpreter of academic research findings when designing effective and equitable policies.The three academic panelists have years of experience working with local government to design program evaluations that address both policymakers' interests and answer questions relevant to the academic literature. All three have been PIs on multiple funded evaluations of these policies, with funding coming from the City of Seattle, the National Institutes of Health, and various philanthropic foundations.\u00a0Some topics of discussion will be: Designing research that policymakers will find useful and that can be translated into policy improvements; Working with policymakers and community members to interpret research findings; Securing local government or external funding for policy evaluations; Responding to changes in the policy environment while maintaining planned research goals; Challenges of working closely with policymakers.Policy AreaPoverty and Income PolicySecondary Policy AreaPolitics, Media, and the Policy ProcessModeratorHeather D Hill, University of WashingtonOrganizerMelissa Knox, University of WashingtonSpeakersJessica C Jones-Smith, University of California, IrvineJennie Romich, University of WashingtonMelissa Knox, University of WashingtonRobyn Kumar, City of Seattle, Office of Sustainability & Environment \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

For families working toward economic security, benefits cliffs can be a serious impediment to financial independence. While systemic policy reforms like graduated phase-outs are vital, they remain complex, long-term endeavors. In the interim, state and local governments are working with community partners to pilot strategies such as transitional benefit payments and benefits counseling to mitigate the cliff's impact. There is a lack of evidence on the best mitigation strategies, yet effective approaches are essential to support families\u2019 economic mobility and self-sufficiency. This panel explores implementation lessons and early findings from four different types of programs employing transitional supports.",

Although rural areas of the US have many issues that look the same as issues in urban areas (poverty, housing shortage, workforce shortage, childcare shortage), quite often the solutions must be approached in a different way. The distances and population sparsity of rural areas have a major impact on economies of scale, which in turn affects how policy around these issues must be implemented and the cost of policy implementation. However, because of the wide range of socioeconomic and demographic differences around the country, rural itself can look very different from state to state or even within a state. This gathering would be an opportunity for rural policy professionals from different parts of the country to discuss issues and for those who are simply interested, to learn more about rural issues. Points of discussion could include but are not limited to:",

    "location": "Grand Hyatt Seattle, 1st Floor/Lobby Level, Leonesa 3Session Submission Type: PanelAbstractIn an era of rapid economic and technological change, both state and federal policymakers have increasingly turned to workforce-aligned financial aid programs as a strategic tool to guide students into high-demand fields. These programs represent a significant evolution in postsecondary policy: rather than providing general subsidies for college attendance, they incentivize enrollment in programs that offer strong labor market prospects. This panel brings together four studies offering rigorous new evidence on how such targeted financial aid policies shape students\u2019 postsecondary trajectories and employment outcomes.The first paper evaluates Kentucky\u2019s Work Ready Kentucky Scholarship (WRKS), a statewide last-dollar grant supporting enrollment in certificate and associate programs within state-identified high-demand industries. Using stacked difference-in-differences designs with administrative student-level data, the authors find that WRKS significantly boosts enrollment and credential attainment, with earnings gains emerging within two years of enrollment.The second paper examines Virginia\u2019s Get a Skill, Get a Job, Get Ahead (G3) initiative, a bipartisan effort to provide tuition-free community college in fields such as healthcare, IT, and skilled trades. Drawing on statewide administrative data spanning seven cohorts, the study employs individual fixed effects and a regression discontinuity design to estimate impacts on program-field alignment, earnings, and post-college employment. The results suggest that G3 increases alignment between educational programs and subsequent jobs and leads to higher post-graduation earnings, though its effects on in-college employment are limited.The third and fourth papers turn to federal policies that have long sought to support education-to-employment pipelines. The third paper revisits the National Defense Student Loan (NDSL) program, established in 1958 to expand access to STEM and foreign language fields in the interest of national security. Using newly digitized historical state-level data merged with ACS, Census, and HRS datasets, the authors find that NDSL increases college enrollment and bachelor\u2019s degree attainment, especially in foreign language majors among women. However, the effects on STEM outcomes are more mixed.The fourth paper analyzes the Federal Work-Study (FWS) program, which allows eligible students to work part-time while enrolled in college or technical school. Work-Study positions are typically related to the student\u2019s field of study or geared toward serving the community. Using a difference-in-differences approach with administrative data from a large, multi-campus public college system, the study finds that FWS increases college enrollment, particularly among independent students, even though it has limited effects on persistence, credit accumulation, or graduation.Together, these studies provide timely and policy-relevant evidence on how financial aid can function as a lever for workforce development, helping align student decisions with labor market demand. They also demonstrate how different program designs, from state-administered scholarships to federally supported work and loan programs, can serve as vehicles for closing skill gaps and expanding access. The panel\u2019s findings have direct implications for policymakers seeking to develop student aid programs that are both labor market-responsive and inclusive of historically underserved populations.",

Policies such as the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), the 2014 free care policy reversal, and federal grants have directed more funding to bring more mental health personnel into schools. Medicaid reimbursement for services provided to students is one strategy schools can use to fund and retain mental health professionals, and to that end, the BSCA called for an update by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to the rules that determine what is eligible for reimbursement and how schools can submit for Medicaid reimbursement. Before the 2014 free care policy reversal, schools could not receive Medicaid reimbursement for services unless they were provided via an Individualized Educational Program. Since then, states have the option of expanding Medicaid to take advantage of reimbursement for services provided to any Medicaid-enrolled student. To encourage more states to support reimbursement of school-based health services, the new CMS guide strives to decrease administrative burdens on schools and develop easier methods for requesting reimbursement. Altogether, these are important policy changes to understand and investigate the extent to which they are increasing the presence of health professionals in schools and the receipt of Medicaid-funded school-based health services by children.",

The conventional wisdom on the right is that gun violence is due to characterologically bad people who are not afraid of what the criminal justice system will do to them; that implies the only solution is to disincentive gun violence with the threat of ever-harsher prison penalties. On the left, the view has been that gun violence is due to economically desperate people doing whatever it takes to survive; that implies the only solution is to disincentivize gun violence by improving the alternatives to crime, by ending poverty. Following these conventional wisdoms for the past 100 years has been a road to nowhere; the murder rate in America today is almost exactly the same as it was back in 1900. This plenary session, built around the new book by Jens Ludwig, Unforgiving Places: The Unexpected Origins of American Gun Violence, will argue that conventional wisdom has not been more helpful because it has misunderstood what gun violence in America actually is. Behavioral science provides a better way to understand the problem; with this improved understanding we can see that the problem turns out to be far more preventable than everyone has long believed.",

The first paper presents analysis of longitudinal data (2000-2010) on the racial composition of nearly 3,000 schools and their neighborhoods to understand how the availability of charter and private schools shapes the dynamics between school choice and racial segregation levels in neighborhoods and schools. The second paper presents on the development of a toolkit designed for housing mobility programs to provide families with high-quality information about local school districts, empowering them to access better-resourced schools while promoting educational equity. The third paper presents on a project taking a community-centered and participatory research approach to creating resources and tools that aim to help school districts productively and authentically engage their communities in school integration efforts. Together, these papers underscore the role of community voice, agency, and empowerment in the implementation of sustainable school desegregation and integration practices and policies.Policy AreaSocial Equity and RaceSecondary Policy AreaEducationChairTerris Raiford Ross, American Institutes for ResearchDiscussantEllie Klein, American Institutes for Research (AIR)Individual PresentationsLinked Fates: How the Availability of School Choice Shapes School and Neighborhood Demographic Change - Presenting Author:  Elly M Field, Brown UniversityA Research-Based Framework for School Integration and Improved K-12 Student Experiences in Housing Mobility Programs - Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Alexandra Curley, AMC Research and Consulting, LLC; Presenting Author:  Thomas Samuel Silverstein, Poverty & Race Research Action CouncilThe Equitable Collaboration Playbook: Using Participatory Research to Support Community Engagement Efforts toward School Integration - Presenting Author:  Christopher Paek, American Institutes for Research; Presenting Author:  Paula Dias, American Institutes for ResearchThe Ties That Revitalize: Community-Based Organizations and Their Impact on Subjective Well-Being - Presenting Author:  David Okereke, Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State UniversityOrganizerChristopher Paek, American Institutes for Research \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

DeLuca and Rosen (2022) argue that a rigorous sociology of housing should draw out the social contexts in which people are accessing the housing market. Scholars have also recently highlighted the need to better integrate racialized residential sorting patterns in understanding people\u2019s housing outcomes (Hwang and Zhang, forthcoming). Much research has paid attention to topics such as eviction or gentrification, but housing encompasses much more than these events. Indeed, the expansion of housing as a research area opens many opportunities for rich interdisciplinary discussions. A robust social science of housing needs to examine the role of micro-, meso-, and macro-level factors driving where people live. \u00a0This panel deepens our understandings of the myriad stakeholders and institutions at play, in conjunction with market and demographic forces, to shape individual residential outcomes. We aim to advance critical and timely conversations about the factors perpetuating or ameliorating housing insecurity and racial inequality in residential outcomes. The work presented in the panel spans disciplines and uses a breadth of cutting-edge methods, qualitative and quantitative, to answer pressing questions in the housing and community development space.The first paper by Louis orients the panel by providing a high-level, national view of the rental housing market in the most recent decade. The study proposes a framework of \u201ccorporate renter resegregation\u201d to understand how rental market investors respond to and sustain a racially segregated housing market. This study uses an analysis of almost 23 million parcel records from 2010\u20132020 and a novel counterfactual simulation to measure racial segregation. The second paper by Leung zooms in on immigrant enclaves, providing insights on the role of immigration and immigrant communities in an era of residential instability and rapid neighborhood change. This study applies spatial analyses to 2000-2019 Census and ACS data.\u00a0The third and fourth papers move the panel in the direction of the most disadvantaged on the housing market \u2013 those renters on the verge of becoming homeless and those who are currently experiencing homelessness. The third study highlights systemic issues that undermine renters from accessing their legal rights, even in a liberal and tenant-protective context. Despite awareness of tenant rights, low-income renters are often alienated from legal systems due to power imbalances and immediate affordability concerns. This study uses qualitative methods, drawing on a unique, racially stratified sample of low-income renters in the City of Oakland informed by a purposive sampling design. Lastly, Tien\u2019s study examines the role of surrogate kinship networks in supporting individuals who have lost or do not have access to traditional kinship ties. Based on comparative fieldwork conducted in three sites and archival research, this study highlights the importance of social capital and community ties in preventing vulnerable people from entering homelessness.Policy AreaHousing, Community Development, and Urban PolicySecondary Policy AreaPoverty and Income PolicyChairAlex Ramiller, University of TorontoDiscussantsAlex Ramiller, University of TorontoWarren Robert Lowell, Vanderbilt UniversityOrganizerIris Zhang, Stanford UniversityIndividual PresentationsCorporate Ownership Growth and the Resegregation of Renters, 2010\u20132020. - Presenting Author:  Renee Louis, Stanford UniversityPersistence of Immigrant Enclaves: Stability, Succession, or Stuck in Place? - Presenting Author:  Lillian Leung, Princeton UniversityStrong Protections v.

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 5th Floor, 501 - ChiwawaSession Submission Type: Late-Breaking RoundtableAbstractThe United States has significantly higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality than other high-income countries, which is driven, in part, by inadequate access to health insurance and health care. Health insurance coverage before, during and after pregnancy is associated with increased access to care and improved maternal health outcomes. Over the last 15 years, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) alongside state-level Medicaid policies have notably improved health insurance coverage and care during and after pregnancy. However, the July 2025 Federal Budget Reconciliation Law (i.e., \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d [OBBB]) includes numerous provisions that threaten health insurance coverage and care for pregnant people, particularly for low- and moderate-income pregnant people who rely on Medicaid and ACA Marketplaces. For instance, OBBB includes provisions that increase the administrative burden of enrolling in Medicaid and Marketplace plans, shorten enrollment windows and retroactive coverage, limit eligibility for immigrants, and restrict reimbursement for reproductive health services. As states react to cuts to federal Medicaid spending, there will be further reductions to Medicaid eligibility, covered benefits, and provider payment rates, which will have immediate impacts on pregnant and postpartum patients and the health care ecosystems that serve them. The panelists for the late-breaking roundtable will discuss how provisions of the OBBB are expected to impact health insurance coverage and health care for pregnant and postpartum people in the U.S. The panelists will discuss the implications of the OBBB for pregnant people within the context of Medicaid, ACA Marketplaces, and immigrant health, and how recent threats to national health databases limit our ability to monitor the impact of these policy changes. Panelists will highlight relevant evidence from recent and ongoing research on health insurance coverage and care for pregnant people and discuss potential state-level policy responses that could help mitigate the negative impact of the OBBB on maternal health. The roundtable will actively engage the audience by offering a Q&A period after each talk and eliciting audience input on research priorities and potential state-level policy responses.Policy AreaHealth PolicySecondary Policy AreaFamily and Child PolicyOrganizerMargaret McConnell, Harvard UniversitySpeakersMegan Cole Brahim, Harvard UniversityLaura Garabedian, Harvard University \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 7th Floor, 703 - HokoSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractLGBTQ+ individuals have long faced structural barriers and social stigmas that shape their experiences across a range of domains, including health, economic opportunity, and political representation. These challenges often manifest in unique and understudied ways, particularly given the historical lack of data that adequately captures the realities of sexual minority populations. This session brings together three papers that use creative empirical strategies and novel data sources to examine how LGBTQ+ individuals respond to risk and exclusion in the United States. Together, these studies offer important insights into behavioral adaptations, political resilience, and economic mobility among marginalized communities.The first paper leverages a newly digitized dataset of over 170,000 personal ads posted by sexual minority men in the nation\u2019s largest LGBTQ+ publication during the early years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This dataset offers rare, time-stamped insights into the preferences and behaviors of a population often missing from conventional surveys. By combining machine learning, historical newspaper archives, and causal inference strategies, the paper identifies how individuals adapted their behavior in response to the earliest reports of AIDS.The second paper examines the mental health consequences of hate crimes and assesses the role of LGBTQ+ political representation in mitigating those effects. Using data from public health surveillance systems, federal hate crime statistics, and biographical records of elected officials, the study employs a difference-in-differences framework to evaluate whether communities with LGBTQ+ leaders experience smaller declines in mental health following increases in hate crime. The results highlight the protective capacity of descriptive representation in the face of identity-based threats.The third paper documents persistent intergenerational mobility gaps between LGBQ and heterosexual individuals in the United States. Using nationally representative survey data and comparisons between LGBQ respondents and their heterosexual siblings, the study isolates how economic outcomes diverge even within families. It explores how occupational sorting and gendered labor market dynamics contribute to these disparities, while pointing to unexplained gaps that suggest deeper structural inequities.Together, these papers offer new evidence on how LGBTQ+ populations adapt to risk and exclusion, and demonstrate the power of innovative data and methods in uncovering these dynamics.Policy AreaPopulation and Migration IssuesSecondary Policy AreaSocial Equity and RaceChairNathaniel M Tran, University of Illinois, ChicagoDiscussantsNathaniel M Tran, University of Illinois, ChicagoBryce J Stanley, University of North Carolina WilmingtonOrganizerHasan Shahid, University of Maryland, Baltimore CountyIndividual PresentationsBehavioral Responses to Risk: Evidence from Personal Ads - Presenting Author:  Hasan Shahid, University of Maryland, Baltimore CountyThe Social Consequence of Hate Crime and Role of Sexual Minority Politicians in Community Responses - Presenting Author:  Ke Zeng, NORC at the University of ChicagoCharacterizing Misreporters: Evidence on LGBQ Wage and Mental Health Gaps - Presenting Author:  Cameron Hill Deal, Harvard UniversityLGBTQ Identity in Adolescence and the Peer Effects of \u201cComing Out\u201d - Presenting Author:  Hannah Ruebeck, Hamilton College \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

    "location": "Grand Hyatt Seattle, 1st Floor/Lobby Level, Portland BSession Submission Type: RoundtableAbstractEvaluating child welfare programs and services requires cooperation and coordination with agency administrators, program managers, and front-line workers. The evaluation can require staff to conduct additional activities, organize their work differently from their normal procedures, and involve connections with other agencies not involved with the particular program or service. Most of these challenges can be overcome when agencies feel committed to understanding whether a program or service \u201cworks\u201d and when researchers design and resource their evaluation to meet the needs of the agency. This roundtable brings together researchers who have experience working with child welfare agencies and service providers to conduct rigorous program evaluations, and agency staff who have experienced evaluations from the \u201cinside.\u201d The researchers will discuss key challenges they have observed when considering evaluations involving child welfare agencies such as (1) agencies don\u2019t typically plan for the resources required for evaluations; (2) staff burden is significant; (3) data sharing requires substantial resources and collaboration within and across agencies; (4) timelines for sharing results back with agencies are long; and (5) resistance to randomized control trials (RCTs) and rigorous quasi-experimental designs (QEDs) is common. Next, agency staff will share their reactions and thoughts about the challenges identified by the researchers as well as their own experiences of contending with competing demands, altering established procedures, creating tracking systems, and sharing data across agencies and with evaluators. They will also describe the factors that influenced their agency\u2019s willingness and ability to undergo a rigorous program evaluation (e.g., input into study design, resources to support the randomization and data sharing process, commitment to evidence-driven decision making). Panelists will provide specific examples of evaluations that reflect a diverse set of programs and contexts, including an evaluation of a program for transition age youth in New Jersey; one on New Jersey\u2019s Keeping Families Together program, which provides housing vouchers and services to families in the child welfare system; an evaluation of an intensive, in-home clinical treatment program in Connecticut for families with children (birth to 5 years old inclusive) who are at risk for abuse and/or neglect, poor developmental outcomes and removal from their home due to parental substance use; an Connecticut program serving families using the Multi Dimensional Family Treatment and Recovery Model for adult caregivers that have substance use concerns and are pregnant or have a child 0-5; and an evaluation of HUD\u2019s Family Unification Program (FUP), which provides housing choice vouchers to families in the child welfare system. Finally, panelists will engage session participants in a facilitated, interactive discussion about solutions that can support rigorous evaluation while minimizing the imposition on the agency, and considerations for determining whether a particular program and agency are well suited for implementation of a RCT or QED.Policy AreaFamily and Child PolicyModeratorBridgette Lery, Urban InstituteOrganizerMichael Pergamit, Urban InstituteSpeakersPamela Lilleston, State of New JerseyMark Courtney, University of ChicagoShannon Michelle Quinn, Washington State Department of Children, Youth & Families \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

    "end_time": "5:00pm",
    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 5th Floor, 504 - FossSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractInterest and investment in Career and Technical Education (CTE) is experiencing a boom across the country with 33 state governors describing priorities related to CTE and workforce development in their 2025 State of the State addresses (Bloomquist & Peisach, 2025). While most public high schools offer some form of CTE and over 80% of high school graduates participate in CTE (NCES, 2024), there are vast differences in the resources that schools dedicate to CTE and wide variety in the amount and quality of CTE programs available to students. In the context of this growing interest there is even greater need for rigorous research on relationships between CTE participation and student outcomes. Yet estimating the causal effects of CTE participation is fraught with challenges, perhaps the largest of which is that students are not randomly assigned to participate in CTE so comparisons to non-CTE students or CTE students in different fields are often skewed by selection biases. In recent years, robust partnerships between researchers and state Department of Education offices have enabled the use of statewide administrative data to paint a more detailed picture of CTE inputs and outcomes. The four papers in this panel use state data to describe patterns of CTE teacher attrition, student enrollment in CTE, and relationships between CTE participation and important outcomes including high school graduation, industry-recognized credential attainment, postsecondary enrollment, employment, and wages.Using data from Massachusetts, Michigan, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington, Carruthers et. al. explore how the COVID-19 pandemic affected CTE teacher attrition rates across these diverse states. Jacob, Miller, & Ricks use longitudinal data on students and schools in Texas to describe changes in CTE course offerings and student enrollment over time and exploit within-school changes in CTE options to estimate causal relationships between CTE participation and later postsecondary education and employment trajectories. Yoon and Dougherty use administrative data from Massachusetts to examine whether students just above or below a consequential 10th grade standardized test score cutoff are more likely to enroll in CTE and assess whether CTE participation is significantly related to education and workforce outcomes. Finally, Meissner and Jacob use data from Michigan to explore whether gender and racial disparities in the attainment of industry-recognized credentials in high school CTE programs is explained by strong patterns of student sorting into different career clusters or more related to differences in credential attainment rates at the school level.As more states invest in building comprehensive statewide longitudinal data systems that link K12 education data, postsecondary data, and employment data, the potential for collaboration between researchers and state agencies is growing every year. These papers collectively illustrate the power of leveraging administrative data for conducting policy-relevant research that can inform decisions at local, state, and national levels to foster more inclusive and effective educational opportunities that prepare all students for future success.Policy AreaEducationSecondary Policy AreaEmployment and Training ProgramsChairMatt Giani, University of Texas at AustinDiscussantsShaun M Dougherty, Boston CollegeBlake H Heller, University of HoustonOrganizerLynn Meissner, University of Michigan Ann ArborIndividual PresentationsPost-Pandemic CTE Teacher Attrition Across Five States - Presenting Author:  Roddy Theobald, American Institutes for ResearchSelection into Technical Education and Postsecondary Outcomes at the Academic Threshold - Presenting Author:  Yerin Yoon, Boston CollegeThe Effect of CTE on Long-Run Education and Labor Market Outcomes: New Evidence from Texas - Presenting Author:  Brian Aaron Jacob, University of MichiganAttainment of Industry Recognized Credentials in Michigan\u2019s CTE Programs: Variations Within and Across Career Clusters - Presenting Author:  Lynn Meissner, University of Michigan Ann Arbor \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

How does the U.S. compare with other high-income countries? In his Kershaw Lecture, Parolin addresses these questions and more.

    "location": "Grand Hyatt Seattle, 1st Floor/Lobby Level, Discovery ASession Submission Type: PanelAbstractHigh-quality early childhood care and education (ECCE) is critical for child development and family well-being. However, enrollment in ECCE programs is both shaped by and impacts a range of other policy domains. Some of these cross-sector relationships are familiar if not sufficiently well-studied. For instance, policymakers often see ECCE not only as a foundation for school readiness but also as a lever to support labor force participation, particularly among mothers, by alleviating care responsibilities. Additionally, programs such as pre-kindergarten and kindergarten by definition influence school enrollment numbers and budgeting. Socioeconomic policies\u2014especially those affecting employment\u2014can, in turn, influence ECCE access and participation. These interdependencies create a complex policy ecosystem that this panel seeks to unpack.",

    "location": "Grand Hyatt Seattle, 1st Floor/Lobby Level, Leonesa 2Session Submission Type: PanelAbstractDespite demand, high-quality early care and education (ECE) is less accessible to families seeking care for their infants and toddlers (Henly & Adams, 2018; Jessen-Howard et al., 2018). Yet, this developmental period shapes children\u2019s short- and long-term outcomes (Choi et al., 2019; Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000), and ECE experiences during the infant-toddler years have been linked with positive long-term development (Horm et al., 2022; Pilarz et al., 2019). Various factors may contribute to barriers in accessing infant-toddler care, such as affordability (Paschall et al., 2021), requirements for lower child-staff ratios (Sandstrom et al., 2011), and alignment with families\u2019 needs (Paschall et al., 2021). However, more work is needed to explore barriers and factors that influence enrollment of infants and toddlers.",

Haupert and Keenan evaluate how mortgage lenders in California respond to increasing wildfire risks in their underwriting and loan approval decisions. Using loan-level data from 2018\u20132020 and wildfire risk measures, the study finds evidence that lenders are employing different risk management techniques, with traditional lenders assigning higher risk to properties in wildfire-prone areas compared to fintech lenders. Han and Johnson leverage high-resolution smart meter data from a municipal utility to investigate the relationships between community NGOs and recovery from power outages after three major hurricanes in Tallahassee, FL. Initial results indicate that the spatial distribution of NGOs may actually contribute to inequalities in power outage duration rather than alleviate them, although additional analyses will evaluate if this finding varies by NGO type.",

Cash has been proposed as a potential solution to a variety of social needs and problems, including reducing food and housing insecurity and incarceration, and improving child development, educational engagement, and health outcomes (Lowrey, 2025). Furthermore, cash transfers are being tested with many specific populations or groups, such as families considered to be at high risk for child maltreatment, women experiencing intimate partner violence, young adults transitioning out of the foster care system, and low-income fathers (Lowrey, 2025).",

A key part of the country\u2019s research infrastructure, FFCWS follows children from birth through young adulthood, enabling researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to understand the impacts of family structure, education, employment, income, health, housing, and resource sharing on human development.\u00a0FFCWS serves as a vital public resource, with data made widely available to researchers, policymakers, and practitioners. More than 8,700 researchers have utilized FFCWS data to generate insights that inform research\u00a0agendas, public policy, and social programs. The vast majority of the study's data are accessible for free through public use processes with more sensitive data available through a contract process.\u00a0This workshop is designed for both researchers who are interested in learning about using the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study data for the first time and current FFCWS data users who would like a deeper dive into navigating our data. This workshop will include \u00a01) a brief overview of the FFCWS, including the history of the study, variety of survey and activity components included in our data, and an overview of the file structure, contents, and data conventions used in FFCWS; and 2) a panel discussion on how FFCWS data can be used in policy research from diverse speakers who have been using the data in their research. Our goals for this workshop are to provide a solid background for working with FFCWS data and to share with participants how FFCWS data can be used in policy research from existing data users.The workshop will involve three major components:",

The program\u2019s existing income eligibility reimbursement system leads to administrative burden among schools and families, confusion among families on eligibility requirements, and stigma among children, all of which drive under-utilization. Universal free school meal policies, where children receive school meals at no cost, are a possible policy solution to improve participation and child well-being. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) is one type of universal free school meals policy; high-need schools, groups of schools, or districts are eligible to opt into serving meals to all children at no cost. During the COVID-19 pandemic, USDA administered a federal emergency waiver where all states could opt into serving meals at no cost. When this waiver expired in June 2022, some states passed legislation to maintain statewide universal free school meals policies, providing meals at no cost to all schools within the state, starting in the 2022-2023 school year.",

The first paper analyzes the effects of classifying gabapentin as a controlled substance on prescribing patterns, co-prescribing with opioids, and potential substitution to other treatments. The second paper studies the impact of local alcohol legalization in Texas, finding that expanded access does not increase alcohol-related traffic fatalities, likely due to shifts in the types of establishments driving availability. The third paper explores the effects of tobacco taxes on youth smoking and marijuana use, identifying important substitution patterns that shape the effectiveness of tax-based deterrents. The fopurth paper studies the long-term effects of increasing the Minimum Legal Drinking Age on Organ Failure.

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 5th Floor, 504 - FossSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractThe COVID-19 pandemic served as an inflection point for education policy in the United States, catalyzing rapid and widespread expansion of school choice programs and policies. In just the past five years, more than a dozen states have enacted new or expanded existing voucher or Education Savings Account (ESA) programs, with many adopting near-universal eligibility provisions (EdChoice, 2025). Simultaneously, charter school policies have also evolved, with several states enacting legislation to lift enrollment caps, streamline authorization processes, and ensure greater funding parity with traditional public schools (National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, 2023). These policy shifts reflect a broader post-pandemic movement toward more flexible, parent-directed educational opportunities, largely in response to family dissatisfaction with remote learning, school closures, and perceived gaps in educational quality during the pandemic (Malkus, 2021; Gross & Opalka, 2022). Collectively, these changes have intensified longstanding debates about the effectiveness and equity of market-based reforms in K\u201312 education, especially as student achievement gaps by race, income, and other characteristics have grown further since the pandemic\u2019s onset (U.S. Department of Education, 2025; Lake & Hill, 2025).The papers within this panel will explore the implications of expanded school choice during and after the pandemic for student enrollment and achievement, educator labor markets, and school supply. Using data from two different states (Indiana and Tennessee) along with a nationwide panel of schools, each of the papers will use both descriptive and longitudinal methods to answer the following broad questions: How did enrollment trends shift between traditional public and charter schools across the pre-, during-, and post-pandemic periods? How do the trends in pandemic learning loss and subsequent recovery compare between charter and public schools? How has the supply and composition of Catholic school teachers changed relative to their public school counterparts as vouchers have expanded? How are vouchers and ESAs altering the supply of schools within the educational marketplace? Each of the papers will tease out variation in these broad questions by either student (e.g., by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic background, etc.) or school subgroups (e.g., location, grade level, organization, etc.).Together, the panel offers a timely exploration of the post-pandemic transformation in school choice practices and policies. The two charter school papers on this panel will add to the evidence about enrollment trends and student achievement following the pandemic, providing new evidence on the variation within the charter sector. Meanwhile, the two voucher papers will provide some of the first evidence on the impacts of expanded private school choice on teacher labor markets and the supply of schools across sectors. To further the work of the panel\u2019s papers, we have chosen two discussants who are non-presenting co-authors, as we know they are planning to attend the conference. They will not discuss their own papers. Doug Harris will discuss the two Indiana papers on charter school learning loss recovery and the Catholic school teacher labor market. Shaun Dougherty will discuss the Tennessee charter school enrollment paper and the nationwide school supply paper.Policy AreaEducationChairJoseph J Ferrare, University of Washington BothellDiscussantsDouglas N Harris, Tulane UniversityShaun M Dougherty, Boston CollegeIndividual PresentationsPatterns in Tennessee Charter School Enrollment Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic - Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Adam Kho, University of Kentucky; Presenting Author:  Shelby Leigh Smith, University of Southern California; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Ron W Zimmer, University of KentuckyVouchers, Catholic Schools, and Teacher Workforce Dynamics: Evidence from Indiana - Presenting Author:  Joseph Waddington, University of Notre Dame; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Shaun M Dougherty, Boston College; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Julie Dallavis, University of Notre Dame; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Kiara Sanchez, Boston College; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Isabel J Thompson, University of Notre DameVoucher Effects on School Entry and Exit - Presenting Author:  MATIAS IGNACIO MORALES, Tulane University; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Douglas N Harris, Tulane UniversityThe Variation in Charter and Public School Learning Loss Recovery in Indiana - Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Mark Berends, University of Notre Dame; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Julie Dallavis, University of Notre Dame; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Joseph J Ferrare, University of Washington Bothell; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Adam Kho, University of Kentucky; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Stephen Ponisciak, University of Notre Dame; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Joseph Waddington, University of Notre Dame; Presenting Author:  Ron W Zimmer, University of KentuckyOrganizerJoseph Waddington, University of Notre Dame \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

Likewise, this unequal exposure is often compounded by pre-existing disparities in social infrastructure, public policy implementation, and geographic vulnerability, further reinforcing environmental and social inequities. Moreover, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the heterogeneous impacts of natural disasters across disadvantaged groups, as well as\u00a0the role that current\u00a0infrastructures and public policies\u00a0play in exacerbating the conditions for these groups during extreme climate events.

Many metropolitan areas, as well as smaller localities, continue to have restrictive zoning and land use regulations that contribute to housing shortages and rising costs. In response, states are exploring various policy interventions, from setting housing production targets for local governments, to preempting local land use regulations that limit density and stymie the diversity of housing types, to cutting fees and local permitting discretion. Many of the new state interventions have passed with bipartisan support. The pioneering states include both \"blue states\" with high housing costs (e.g., California), and \"red states\" where prices have not escalated as much (e.g., Montana, Florida, Texas).

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 5th Floor, 503 - DuckabushSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractOver the last decade, California has emerged as a contested battleground in efforts to reform the criminal legal system. In some years, legislators, referendums, and criminal justice agencies have instituted major policy changes that reduce costs of criminal legal involvement and increase transparency; in other years, policymakers, voters, and judges roll back these changes, or implement new approaches that take a more punitive approach to crime control. Our panel assesses the impact of three such major policy changes across the nation\u2019s largest state. First, Premkumar et al. uses a triple difference framework to assess the impact of bail suspensions on recidivism during the COVID-19 pandemic, finding that bail suspensions raised overall rearrest rates but that reinstatement of bail did not reverse these changes. Second, Walia reports on validating a generative AI algorithm that is used to support the state's mandate that all prosecutors conduct race-blind charging decisions. And third, Cremin uses panel data to examine associations between California's rising homelessness and local area factors including housing and economic conditions along with measures of incarceration rates, then uses a difference-in-differences framework to identify causal impacts of Prop 47 reforms on homelessness rates.The changes evaluated in this panel promise to inform future criminal legal policymaking across the country. Some reforms, like the suspension of cash bail, may have impacted public safety. On the other hand, efforts to achieve criminal legal reform (e.g., rolling back felony penalties for drug use) may have contributed to more negative outcomes in other domains like homelessness. In assembling these papers, we show how evidence from a diverse set of policy changes will help a diverse range of stakeholders\u2014including policymakers and the public\u2014support new efficient and fair policies that address complex challenges in the criminal legal system.Policy AreaCrime, Justice, and DrugsChairAlex Chohlas-Wood, New York UniversityDiscussantsJohanna Lacoe, University of California, BerkeleyCandace Hamilton Hester, American Institutes for ResearchOrganizerAlex Chohlas-Wood, New York UniversityIndividual PresentationsWhat Happened When California Suspended Bail? - Presenting Author:  Deepak Premkumar, Public Policy Institute of CaliforniaCan Generative AI Help Deliver Justice?

Colleges and states are pursuing varying approaches to address student basic needs such as food pantries and emergency aid (e.g., California Community College Chancellor\u2019s Office, 2024; Hodara et al., 2023; Nix et al., 2023). Some college and state efforts have focused on increasing student access to public benefit programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid (e.g., Burnside, Gilkesson, and Baker, 2021; Duke-Benfield and Davis, 2024; Ladkau and Ward, 2022; Loofbourrow and Scherr, 2023; Swipe Out Hunger, 2024). College students face barriers to accessing programs like SNAP due to complex eligibility requirements and administrative processes (Larin, 2024).State and college outreach and application support efforts aim to help college students to navigate these processes and access additional benefits to address student basic needs and minimize barriers to academic success.",

Panelists will explore the consequences of constrained budgets, workforce attrition, and declining survey response rates for the quality, reliability, and continuity of federal data. The discussion will also consider challenges to the independence and credibility of statistical agencies, particularly as political pressures intensify and demands for more rapid, localized, and granular data grow. In addition, panelists will assess how evolving privacy expectations, rapid technological advances, and the expansion of private-sector data sources are reshaping both the production and dissemination of official statistics, raising questions about sustainability, comparability, and public trust. Ultimately, the session will highlight what is at stake for evidence-based policymaking and identify potential strategies for strengthening and safeguarding the nation\u2019s statistical infrastructure.Policy AreaMethods and Tools of AnalysisSecondary Policy AreaPolitics, Media, and the Policy ProcessOrganizerJonathan Schwabish, Urban InstituteSpeakersErica Lynn Groshen, Cornell UniversityKosali Simon, Indiana UniversityDavid Johnson, International Association for Research in Income and WealthJordan D Matsudaira, American University \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

Cheng and Li use linked Health and Retirement Study (HRS) with Medicare data to evaluate how Medicare reimbursement for Advance Care Planning affects the adoption of advance directives at the end of life. Topal and colleagues analyze administrative records from the Military Health System to compare utilization, expenditures, and quality of HIV care between public and private facilities within a single-payer context, addressing endogeneity in care assignment. Fox, Hart, and Li use nationally representative survey data to document disparities in preventive healthcare use and chronic disease outcomes between sexual minority and heterosexual older adults. Collectively, these studies provide comparative insights across populations and care settings, highlighting how financing mechanisms, institutional design, and patient identity intersect to influence the quality and efficiency of care for individuals with chronic conditions.Policy AreaHealth PolicyChairJing Li, University of WashingtonDiscussantsHasan Shahid, University of Maryland, Baltimore CountySumedha Gupta, Indiana UniversityOrganizerLeslie Ofori, APPAMIndividual PresentationsMedicare Reimbursement for Advance Care Planning and Presence of Advance Directives: Evidence from Health and Retirement Study- Medicare Linked Data - Presenting Author:  Zilin Cheng, University of Washington; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Jing Li, University of WashingtonDisparities in Preventive Healthcare Utilization and Health Outcomes Among Sexual Minority and Heterosexual Older Adults - Presenting Author:  Julia Fox, University of Washington; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Jing Li, University of Washington; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Laura HartThe Impact of Nurse Practitioner Autonomy on Patient Sorting and Health Outcomes - Presenting Author:  Sooa Ahn, The Ohio State University \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

In part I, we use the potential outcomes and counterfactual framework to interpret how much bias there must be to nullify an inference.\u00a0 This supports statements such as \u201cTo nullify the inference, __% of the data would have to be replaced with counterfactual cases for which there was no effect.\u201d In part II, we quantify the robustness of causal inferences in terms of correlations associated with unobserved variables. This supports statements such as \u201cTo nullify the inference an omitted variable would have to be correlated at __ with both the focal predictor and outcome.\u201d By leveraging intuition based on potential outcomes and correlations with omitted variables, these techniques inform collaborative evidence generation and evaluation among a broad set of stakeholders. Furthermore, because the techniques are functions of quantities commonly reported in published studies (e.g., estimated effect, standard error) they can be broadly applied and extended (e.g., logistic regression, hazard, propensity score based). Specifically, the techniques have already been widely employed in policy, education, sociology, epidemiology, and management, as well as in general science (e.g., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences).",

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 5th Floor, 506 - SamishSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractAs communities in the wildland-urban interface (WUI) face ever-growing risk from wildfires, it is crucial that government agencies, utility providers, and communities themselves engage in proactive risk mitigation. These efforts are supported by a number of intersecting and overlapping policies at the federal, state, and local levels. This panel discusses the roles of agency capacity, community organization, and utility planning in mitigating WUI wildfire risk, as well as the policies that define the geography of the WUI itself. The first paper investigates the ways in which state policy incentivizes electric utilities in the U.S. West to develop and adopt wildfire mitigation plans. The second paper examines the effect of personnel unavailability on the execution of prescribed burns in National Forests. The third paper focuses on the formation and operation of Prescribed Burn Associations (PBAs) and their efficacy in implementing prescribed burns and mobilizing communities. The fourth paper evaluates the growth of WUI communities using property records to identify rapidly growing areas as well as communities that may have been overlooked by prior WUI mapping methods. Together, these papers cover a range of policy issues relating to WUI wildfire risk mitigation. The panel provides policy insights with significant implications for how actors in different agencies and organizations can best reduce the threat to homes, lives, and livelihoods posed by wildland fires.Policy AreaNatural Resource, Energy, and Environmental PolicySecondary Policy AreaNational & Homeland Security and Crisis ManagementDiscussantsGwen Arnold, University of California, DavisNicola Ulibarri, University of California, IrvineOrganizerReed Jonathan Humphrey, University of WashingtonIndividual PresentationsOwnership, liability risk, and planning for utility-caused wildfires - Presenting Author:  Ryan P Scott, Colorado State UniversityAnalyzing Prescribed Burn Associations: Network Structures, Resource Mobilization, and Policy Outcomes - Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Tyler A Scott, University of California, Davis; Presenting Author:  Sara Ludwick, University of California, DavisMapping the Trajectories of Community Wildfire Exposure - Presenting Author:  Reed Jonathan Humphrey, University of Washington \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

    "end_time": "3:15pm",
    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 6th Floor, 608 - WynocheeSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractThese four studies offer compelling evidence of how the growing localization of immigration enforcement in the United States generates far-reaching consequences not only for immigrant communities but also for the broader public. As federal authorities increasingly delegate immigration enforcement to state and local actors through mechanisms such as 287(g) agreements, Secure Communities, and criminal sentencing reforms, the research highlights how localized decisions shape deportation risk, labor markets, public trust, and service delivery. In the first paper, criminal sentencing reform policies, reducing misdemeanor sentencing by a single day, are investigated for their potential to reduce deportation exposure without compromising public safety, illustrating how targeted reforms may help decouple the criminal and immigration systems. The second study investigates whether, during periods of economic strain such as the Great Recession, localities facing heightened labor market pressures were more likely to adopt exclusionary immigration enforcement policies, highlighting how economic anxieties may fuel anti-immigrant responses. The third paper explores the behavioral consequences of local enforcement, examining whether programs like 287(g) not only chill undocumented immigrants\u2019 participation in everyday life but also prompt behavioral changes among legal residents and citizens who share ethnic ties, pointing to the broader social reach of profiling and intimidation. Finally, the fourth study shifts the lens to the healthcare sector, investigating whether aggressive enforcement programs like Secure Communities reduce the quality of home healthcare by disrupting the immigrant labor supply crucial to elder care, with implications for patient outcomes, Medicaid spending, and public health planning, especially in for-profit agencies. These studies, taken together, underscore how immigration enforcement, often framed as a national security issue, profoundly affects local governance, labor markets, healthcare delivery, and the lived experiences of both immigrants and citizens, raising urgent questions about justice, equity, and accountability.Policy AreaPopulation and Migration IssuesSecondary Policy AreaCrime, Justice, and DrugsChairStephanie Potochnick, University of North Carolina, CharlotteDiscussantsJose Bucheli, University of Texas - El PasoAlejandro Gutierrez-Li, North Carolina State UniversityOrganizerJoaquin Alfredo-Angel Rubalcaba, University of North Carolina, Chapel HillIndividual PresentationsThe Difference a Day Makes: Can Changes to US Criminal Misdemeanor Sentencing Influence Deportation and Crime? - Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Alberto Ortega, Indiana University; Presenting Author:  Joaquin Alfredo-Angel Rubalcaba, University of North Carolina, Chapel HillEliminating the Competition?

These factors and high housing costs have contributed to a dramatic increase in the share of children living with multiple generations (parents and grandparents) (Pilkauskas et al., 2018), particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic (Amorim et al., 2023). Multi-generation households could facilitate the care of both children and older adults.

With national community college six-year graduation rates remaining around 40% (National Student Clearinghouse, 2024), identifying effective structural interventions has become increasingly urgent for two-year institutions. By exploring co-requisite support models, course length variations, and compressed course formats, these papers collectively contribute to our understanding of how course structure modifications can influence completion rates, persistence, and academic achievement at two-year institutions.

    "end_time": "3:15pm",
    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 7th Floor, 706 - PilchuckSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractThe rise in union instability has transformed families around the world, with children in Europe and the Americas being particularly likely to live apart from their father (IFS and Wheatley Institution, 2019; Laplante et al., 2015; Liu et al, 2017). In a wide range of countries, single-mother families are disproportionately poor when compared to two-parent families (Cuesta, 2022). There are different policy approaches to the economic vulnerability of single mothers, with some countries providing modest government support\u2014encouraging single mothers\u2019 employment and nonresident fathers\u2019 child support payments\u2014and others with robust social safety nets\u2014providing publicly-funded benefits to single-mother families. This panel brings together four papers that provide new, cross-disciplinary, cross-national evidence on how policies affect separated families around the world, with important implications for family and child well-being.The first and second papers investigate the context of economic vulnerability by examining how single mothers leverage different economic resources in Latin America, Europe, and the United States (US). The first paper uses data from the Luxembourg Income Study (waves X\u2013XII, 2017\u20132023) to examine how kin co-residence is associated with single mothers\u2019 employment in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. The second paper uses the European Union Survey of Income and Living Conditions\u2019 ad hoc module (EU-SILC 2021) and the U.S. Current Population Survey to examine income sources of single-mother families by type of child custody in six European Union countries (Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Belgium, France, and Spain) and the US. The third and fourth papers focus on child support from nonresident fathers, a key policy affecting separated families. The third paper examines how child support obligations change when second families are formed in three Latin American countries, the US, and Finland using data obtained through extensive interviews with judicial and social service personnel in Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay and child support experts in the US and Finland. The fourth paper uses the Wisconsin Court Record Database (CRD) to examine the prevalence of income imputation in Wisconsin and how income imputation affects child support outcomes (i.e., amount ordered, likelihood of payment, amount paid, and ratio of paid to ordered amount).The papers not only describe the policy context and policies in place in different countries, but also explore the effects of these policies on children\u2019s economic well-being. The papers have implications for general income support, employment, child custody, and child support policy.Two expert discussants will provide both a researcher\u2019s and a practitioner\u2019s perspective on the implications of these studies for research and policy.Policy AreaFamily and Child PolicySecondary Policy AreaPoverty and Income PolicyChairDaniel R.

Perez and Cassidy\u2019s paper evaluates the Every Child and Family is Known initiative, a cross-agency initiative that assigns students living in shelter a school-based \u201cCaring Adult\u201d to facilitate personalized support, and finds that students in the program experienced improvements in school attendance, math test scores, and school stability. Sell\u2019s research aims to identify characteristics and experiences of high school students that are associated with experiencing homelessness later as a young adult. It finds that students experiencing homelessness, foster care, or receiving child welfare prevention services were most likely to experience homelessness as a young adult and will benefit from targeted service delivery at critical times in their lives. Finally, Mullan\u2019s work examines the characteristics, care trajectories, and outcomes among individuals engaged through clinician-led involuntary removals, after New York City government issued a directive to a more expansively interpretation of the circumstances under which an individual may be involuntarily removed from a public area and transported to a hospital. The study finds that removals most frequently occurred in subway stations and that individuals were most frequently transported to public hospitals; a high percentage of individuals were admitted to hospitals, there was a high prevalence of chronic mental illness, and many had been engaged with the City\u2019s homeless service agency in the year prior to the removal.Policy AreaEducationSecondary Policy AreaHealth PolicyChairMaryanne Schretzman, Center for Innovation through Data IntelligenceDiscussantMarybeth Shinn, Vanderbilt UniversityOrganizerMarya Kuklick, Center for Innovation through Data IntelligenceIndividual PresentationsCaring Adults Improve Outcomes for Students Experiencing Homelessness: Evidence from New York City Public Schools - Presenting Author:  Michael Thomas Cassidy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Glendalis Perez, Center for Innovation through Data IntelligenceClinician-led Involuntary Removals in New York City: Understanding Patterns and Outcomes from an Inter-agency Initiative - Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Jack Mullan, NYC Department of Social Services; Presenting Author:  Kinsey Dinan, NYC Department of Social Services; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Edith M.

    "location": "Grand Hyatt Seattle, 1st Floor/Lobby Level, Princess 1Session Submission Type: PanelAbstractWidening inequality has been among the most pressing social issues in the U.S. for decades, capturing the attention of social scientists, the public, and policymakers. The share of income going to top income households has increased since the 1970s, while the middle class has seen their share decline. The poverty rate has improved little over this period while both wealth disparities and household indebtedness have grown. Material and financial hardships including homelessness and a reliance on risky and high-cost unsecured credit instruments are growing problems in many U.S. communities. Economic inequality reinforces political inequality and political polarization as the most vulnerable often lack opportunities and resources to participate as fully as their advantaged peers and thus their interests tend to be less represented in policymaking.To challenge or exacerbate inequality, governments around the world have relied on diverse partnerships with various stakeholders. These \"policy partnerships\" have emerged across several dimensions, including levels of government (i.e., federal-state-local), sectors (i.e., public-private), and branches of government (i.e., legislative-executive-judicial). Policy partnerships have the potential to create more transformative and resilient policy changes to address inequality by distributing the burden of administration, financing, rulemaking, and enforcement across stakeholders and governmental units. By bringing different parties together, such partnerships can facilitate more collaboration--addressing this year's APPAM conference theme--between policymakers, researchers, and the public, potentially leading to more dynamic and efficient policy.This panel brings together four timely papers on the role of federal, state, and local policy partnerships for shaping inequalities in income, credit/debt, housing, and civil liberties. The papers cover a range of interventions, inequality outcomes, and institutional settings, including how the administration of U.S. federal safety net policies through state governments shapes black-white inequalities in poverty reduction (van der Naald, Bruch, and Gornick), the effects of the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend on income disparities in high-cost unsecured credit use (Dwyer et al.), the effects of a Supreme Court decision to restrict the enforcement of city anti-camping ordinances on homelessness in Western U.S. cities (Brady, Schachner, and Gannon), and how needs-based federal spending promotes equality in the respect for civil liberties across 160 countries (Ha).Policy AreaPoverty and Income PolicySecondary Policy AreaSocial Equity and RaceChairKassandra Martinchek, George Washington UniversityDiscussantMarianne Bitler, University of California, DavisOrganizerAlec P.

At the same time, more and more working-class voters have been drawn to populist political views and candidates\u2013particularly right-wing populism\u2013 that fuses exclusionary worldviews along with contempt for the underlying norms and institutions of liberal democracy. The rise of right-wing populism poses a significant threat to the health of democracy here and abroad. How should researchers and policymakers think about the connection between these trends in economic conditions and rising support for populist policies? The discussion will explore the role that public policy can play in countering economic and cultural discontent and addressing the intertwined appeal of populism.Policy AreaPolitics, Media, and the Policy ProcessSecondary Policy AreaPoverty and Income PolicyModeratorMelissa Grober-Morrow, Washington Center for Equitable GrowthOrganizerChristian Edlagan, Washington Center for Equitable GrowthSpeakersGbenga Ajilore, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesJustin Gest, George Mason UniversityJacob Leibenluft, Washington Center for Equitable GrowthJamila D Michener, Cornell University \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

This high number of people seeking shelter, tripled New York City\u2019s unhoused population, placing unprecedented strain on the existing shelter system and social services.\u00a0In response, New York City took immediate action and stood up over 200 shelters capable of housing between 60,000 and 70,000 asylum seekers at any given time. Putting new arrivals on the path to self-sufficiency became New York City\u2019s top priority. However, unlike the traditionally unhoused population, new arrivals needed specific immigration related services, such as assistance to apply for an immigration benefit and employment authorization.\u00a0\u00a0This roundtable will explore the different innovative practices that New York City used to address the needs of new arrivals. Panelists will discuss how COVID-19 emergency response mechanisms were used to operationalize shelters and how New York City was able to launch the Asylum Application Help Center (AAHC), the nation\u2019s first city-run pro se legal assistance model to support this population.

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 5th Floor, 501 - ChiwawaSession Submission Type: RoundtableAbstractThe US is experiencing a dual crisis in its housing sector. Home prices and rents are increasing rapidly as housing supply fails to keep up with demand, and climate change and extreme weather events put our existing housing stock at grave risk.\u00a0There is a growing, bipartisan \"pro-housing\" movement in the U.S. that is focused on addressing the first challenge by reducing regulatory barriers and leveraging innovation to boost housing production. But we also need to fortify our existing housing stock against the effects of climate change and anticipate how natural disasters, sea-level rise and extreme weather events will change where and how we build new homes.\u00a0In recent years, an average of 1 in 10 homes in the U.S. have been damaged or destroyed by natural disasters, and it is estimated that climate change will wipe out nearly $1.5 trillion in home values over the next three decades. These costs are already being priced in insurance markets, with a dramatic increase in climate-related claims driving up the costs of property insurance significantly, contributing to increasing cost burdens for homeowners and further constraining housing supply. At the same time, new residential construction in the US continues to occur in high-risk areas and contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, both through the construction process itself and the subsequent energy use of the buildings. And when we build homes far from job centers and services, we further exacerbate climate change through emissions related to transportation and loss of natural habitats that absorb carbon and reduce flood risk.\u00a0Fortunately, many states, regions, and localities across the country are adopting innovative land policies that can both help us address our nation\u2019s housing supply shortage and the urgent need for climate mitigation and adaptation at the same time.\u00a0This roundtable will focus on three broad areas of land policy that have the potential to unlock\u00a0climate and housing solutions simultaneously: land use and zoning regulations; building technology innovations and modern building codes; and land-based finance and land-value capture.\u00a0The panel will also discuss how land policies can be combined with other adaptation tools to reduce risks to communities and lower costs for consumers. Roundtable participants will discuss promising policies, what research suggests about their effectiveness, the equity implications of these policies, and what more is needed to accelerate progress.\u00a0The roundtable will also suggest how the pro-housing and climate-action movements can find common ground in land policy, and what we need to do to build more effective, inclusive, and enduring coalitions.\u00a0Policy AreaHousing, Community Development, and Urban PolicySecondary Policy AreaNatural Resource, Energy, and Environmental PolicyModeratorSolomon J Greene, Lincoln Institute of Land PolicyOrganizerSolomon J Greene, Lincoln Institute of Land PolicySpeakersCarlos Eduardo Martin, Urban InstitutePatrick Welch, Lincoln Institute of Land PolicyEvan Allan Derickson, National Zoning AtlasLotte Schlegel, SC \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

While assets and wealth accumulation are increasingly recognized as vital for economic security, social equity, and upward mobility, our society faces stark wealth inequalities in their distribution by races and socioeconomic factors. Achieving human development and economic security through strategies like savings, investment, homeownership, and retirement savings is not just a matter of individual agency, but also deeply embedded within and significantly influenced by institutional arrangements. Taking a life course perspective, this session delves into the interactions between institutional potential of Child Development Accounts/Child Savings Accounts and personal engagement and actions on wealth accumulation, racial equity, and individual development.",

TIAs focus on recognizing the impact of trauma and promoting resilience through organizational change, while healing-centered engagement expands this work by emphasizing strengths, culture, and collective power. These approaches have gained traction across multiple policy domains, including education, public health, child welfare, violence prevention, substance use, and criminal justice. Since 2015, TIAs have been included in at least 22 federal policies and promoted through initiatives such as statewide offices (e.g., Hawaii) and citywide training programs (e.g., Chicago). Implementation has proven challenging, however. A wide range of experiences can be traumatic, making prevention of trauma complex. Additionally, many public systems\u2014such as education, health, and criminal justice\u2014not only respond to trauma but may also produce it. These dynamics limit the usefulness of one-size-fits-all approach and demand nuanced, collaborative policy responses. The very nature of trauma necessitates cross-sector collaboration in both policy development and implementation.",

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 7th Floor, 708 - Sol DucSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractWe study public policies that are targeted at protecting or supporting older individuals. The first paper studies a very topical question: how does downsizing a government agency affect its ability to fulfill its objective? Studying the Social Security Administration, Gordon finds it reduced the agency's ability to enroll eligible individuals. The next paper studies the impact of recent changes in state-level laws that raised the level of legal protection against age discrimination. Barkowski and McLaughlin find the laws improved wages and employment outcomes for older workers. The next two papers study effects of pension programs on labor supply and retirement. Leganza and his coauthors show not only that workers' retirement decisions are affected by incentives implied by the pension system, but so are their earlier-in-life decisions on supplying their labor in the formal sector. Finally, Kim and his coauthors study the reaction of workers to the incentives of overlapping pension systems, finding that individuals' responses are affected only by the incentives of the primary pension system. Overall, this session shows that public policies have important implications for older workers, and that the resources devoted to implementing these policies can influence their effectiveness.Policy AreaEmployment and Training ProgramsSecondary Policy AreaPublic and Nonprofit Management and FinanceDiscussantsJoanna Lahey, Texas A&M UniversityJing Li, University of WashingtonOrganizerScott J Barkowski, University at BuffaloIndividual PresentationsEmployee Exodus: The Impact of Government Downsizing on Benefit Access - Presenting Author:  Sydney Gordon, University of California, IrvineDo Age Discrimination Laws Protect Older Workers?

From investments in broadband infrastructure to digital literacy as a factor influencing citizens\u2019 interactions with bureaucrats, from the deployment of artificial intelligence to personalize public services to the evolving legal frameworks governing data security and digital governance, the four papers offer a comprehensive analysis of how technology is transforming the public sector and redefining the relationship between government and society.In examining the role of government within this complex context, the panel brings together a blend of theoretical approaches and employs a wide range of methodologies, including geospatial analysis, text analysis and panel data methods. Together, the studies advance theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underpinning more reliable, accountable, and secure applications of technology in the public sector. At the same time, the panel informs practice by examining the impact of policy initiatives and investments aimed at fostering a more just and effective delivery of public goods and services.Policy AreaPublic and Nonprofit Management and FinanceSecondary Policy AreaPublic and Nonprofit Management and FinanceChairCarolyn J.

(Merikangas et al., 2010; Whitney & Peterson, 2019). Barriers to effective care include an insufficient number of community-based providers (Langer et al., 2015), minimal evidence-based practice (EBP) penetration in community settings (Garland et al., 2010; Weisz & Kazdin, 2010), limited knowledge among families about where to find effective treatments (Cauce et al., 2002), and stigma associated with help seeking (Cummings et al., 2013). Schools have repeatedly been identified as key stakeholders due to their unique community position (e.g., the Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning Act (2015) (Rep. Ryan, 2015). School-based mental health care provides services for students where they are and eliminates the need to access services that are far away, threatening, or cost prohibitive (Hoover et al., 2019). Most adolescents never receive needed mental health care treatment, but among those who do, 75% access care exclusively in school (Green et al., 2013; Rones & Hoagwood, 2000), where students are more willing to seek mental health help (Burns et al., 1995; Farmer et al., 2003; Parikh et al., 2019).",

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 7th Floor, 706 - PilchuckSession Submission Type: Paper PanelAbstractPapers featured in this session use primarily quantitative methods to examine policies and programs that aim to support families with children. Specifically, the panel will feature two papers focused on early care and education systems, and two focused on the consequences of state adoption of paid family leave policies. Taken together, the papers on paid family leave (PFL) point toward the significance of such policies for health incomes including parental sleep duration and use of postpartum health care. The early care and education papers explore questions of implementation and uptake. This includes one paper documenting the uptake of subsidized child care among middle-income families when they are made eligible for the program, and another exploring the decision-making processes of early care and education providers when choosing whether to participate in the various programs available for funding early care and education services. Collectively, the papers provide a breadth of perspectives and approaches to the broad questions of whether programs and policies intended to support families with children are effective in doing so, and whether they are taken up by families and service providers as intended.

However, the evidence to date has not provided encouraging evidence regarding effective and scalable ways to increase employment and income for program participants. In addition, an increasing number of participants in rental assistance programs are elderly and disabled, making them less likely to be able to experience increased employment and earnings.",

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 7th Floor, 709 - StillaguamishSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractImmigration remains a highly contentious political issue in the United States. With Congress unable to pass substantial immigration reform, presidents resort to executive orders that vary widely from administration to administration. These frequent changes in immigration policy and sentiment create significant insecurity for immigrants, making it difficult for them to plan their futures, maintain stable employment, and feel safe in their communities. Given this landscape, this panel aims to examine how institutions and policies in the US affect the wellbeing of immigrants residing in the country. The first study investigates how practices in public elementary schools impact the mental health of immigrant students and their parents. These practices include staffing choices (e.g., law enforcement presence), disciplinary differences by race/ethnicity, and enrollment in gifted and talented programs. The second study focuses on state policies affecting undocumented immigrants, highlighting the significant impact of allowing DACA participants to pay in-state tuition for public colleges on their educational attainment and economic stability. The final study examines immigrant workers in the healthcare industry, revealing that noncitizens face greater labor market vulnerability and fewer opportunities to utilize their education. These studies underscore the necessity for policies and practices that prioritize the stability and integration of immigrants into American society. Creating a more predictable and supportive environment for immigrants will ultimately benefit both the individuals and the broader society.Policy AreaSocial Equity and RaceSecondary Policy AreaEducationChairBianca Frogner, University of WashingtonDiscussantTara Elizabeth Watson, Brookings InstitutionIndividual PresentationsSchool practices and the mental health of immigrant/refugee students and their parents - Presenting Author:  Angie Fertig, University of MinnesotaThe Economic and Educational Attainment of DACA Recipients in States with Policies Supporting DACA Students - Presenting Author:  Edwin Torres DeSantiago, University of MinnesotaImmigrants in Healthcare Occupations - Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Arati Dahal, University of Washington; Presenting Author:  Taylor B Rogers, University of HawaiiThe Institutional Castling of the Immigration and Penal Spheres - Presenting Author:  Vicente Celestino Mata, Jr., Cornell UniversityOrganizerAngie Fertig, University of Minnesota \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

Their findings suggest that legal access\u2014not just legal status\u2014has implications for maternal decision-making and infant nutrition.

Selective colleges in the United States\u2014those that receive more applications from qualified applicants than they admit\u2014enroll smaller shares of students from relatively disadvantaged backgrounds, on average, than community colleges, regional public universities, and less selective institutions (Baker et al., 2019; Chetty et al., 2017; Orphan et al., 2022). Research examines the extent to which selective college admissions policies and practices relate to college enrollment, choice, and completion outcomes.\u00a0In this panel, four papers contribute to this growing body of literature by offering evidence regarding the impacts of recent policies and practices in selective college admissions. Three of the papers in the session explore the academic outcomes of test-optional policies, which became widespread during the pandemic when colleges altered admissions policies to allow applicants to choose whether to submit SAT or ACT scores for admissions consideration (Rosinger et al., 2024). The three papers offer insight into the extent to which test-optional policies influence admissions and academic outcomes across a variety of institution types: highly selective private colleges, a selective public flagship institution, and two state universities systems. The fourth paper offers experimental evidence regarding the impact of test score submission and math course taking on potential admissions decisions. Together, these papers offer insight into how recent trends in selective college admissions policy and practice relate to student outcomes across institution types.Policy AreaEducationSecondary Policy AreaFamily and Child PolicyChairKatharine Meyer, Brookings InstitutionDiscussantsKatharine Meyer, Brookings InstitutionRajeev Darolia, University of KentuckyOrganizerKelly Rosinger, Pennsylvania State UniversityIndividual PresentationsExamining the Academic Outcomes Associated with Test-Optional Admissions: Evidence from Two Public University Systems - Presenting Author:  Kelly Rosinger, Pennsylvania State University; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Dominique Baker, University of Delaware; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Joseph Sturm, Pennsylvania State University; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Julie J Park, University of Maryland, College Park; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Julie R Posselt, University of Southern CaliforniaWhat is the relationship between high school grades, test scores, and academic success in college? - Presenting Author:  Nicholas W Hillman, University of Wisconsin-MadisonThe Enrollment Effects of Test-Optional Admissions Policies - Presenting Author:  Zachary Bleemer, Princeton UniversityCalculus as a Gatekeeper in Selective College Admissions?: Insights from a Lab-in-the-Field Experiment with Admissions Officers - Presenting Author:  BK Byun, University of Michigan Ann Arbor; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Michael Bastedo, University of Michigan; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Stephanie Carroll, University of Michigan; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Julius DiLorenzo; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Jeremy Wright-Kim, University of Michigan Ann Arbor \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

    "start_time": "8:30am",
    "end_time": "10:00am",
    "location": "Grand Hyatt Seattle, 1st Floor/Lobby Level, Princess 1Session Submission Type: PanelAbstractMuch of public benefit attainment in programs like SNAP and WIC relates to administrative processes and associated burdens, and many studies take as their premise that addressing these administrative barriers can increase benefit access and retention (Herd & Moynihan, 2018; Giannella et al, 2024; Wu & Meyer, 2021). In a policy environment with substantial devolution in programs like TANF and the potential for future devolution in others (Bruch et al, 2018), understanding patterns of benefit access and retention on a state-by-state level may inform how to make these programs more effective and resilient. Recent research demonstrates that increases in state-level administrative discretion have indeed increased differences in benefit attainment (Herd & Moynihan 2023). This panel brings together state-level analyses of SNAP and WIC cases using administrative data to understand how different elements of program administration impact access and retention, particularly in ways that may impact existing disparities. The first paper, by Basurto et al., studies SNAP take-up differences based on state adoption of online applications. The second paper, by Fox-Dichter et al., describes patterns of churn in the New Jersey SNAP caseload, examining characteristics of the cases most likely to miss four or fewer months of benefits within a few years of SNAP versus those that stayed on SNAP for the duration of that time frame. The third paper, by Bitler et al., examines WIC retention and whether the transition to WIC EBT on the county level impacted recertification in a mountain state. Taken together, these papers will provide insights into how local-level differences and discretion in program administration may impact participants\u2019 access and retention of benefits, identifying opportunities for future state- and local-level improvement, and how states can make use of administrative data as well as online discourse for program learning and improvement.Policy AreaPoverty and Income PolicySecondary Policy AreaSocial Equity and RaceChairAndrea Hetling, Rutgers University - New BrunswickDiscussantsLaura Peck, Rutgers UniversitySwati S Joshi, University of Wisconsin-MadisonOrganizerSophia Fox-Dichter, Rutgers University - New BrunswickIndividual PresentationsThe Role of Technology in the Safety Net: Adoption of Online SNAP Applications - Presenting Author:  Luis E Basurto, Cornell UniversityPatterns of Churn in New Jersey's SNAP Caseload - Presenting Author:  Sophia Fox-Dichter, Rutgers University - New Brunswick; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Andrea Hetling, Rutgers University - New Brunswick; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Kirsten Meidlinger, Rutgers University - New BrunswickEffects of EBT on Program Enrollment: Evidence from a Mountain State - Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Marianne Bitler, University of California, Davis; Presenting Author:  Caitlin Shamoly Dutta, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Seojung Oh, University of North Carolina, Charlotte; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Jason B Cook \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

    "location": "Grand Hyatt Seattle, 1st Floor/Lobby Level, Discovery ASession Submission Type: PanelAbstractAlthough expert knowledge is essential in health care, the resulting asymmetry of information gives rise to conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and agency problems \u2013 situations where the interests of experts diverge from those of the people they are meant to serve. This session examines different aspects of agency problems in health care and avenues for regulation.The first paper concerns itself with the influence of pharmaceutical industry payments to physicians and the potential ability of medical professionalism to limit industry influence. The authors examine heterogeneity in altruism, a key component of professionalism. Linking experimental measures of altruism to administrative data, the authors find that non-altruistic physicians receive significantly more industry payments and are more responsive to them in their prescribing behavior. In contrast, altruistic physicians appear less susceptible to industry influence, suggesting professionalism can play a meaningful role in moderating physician-industry relationships.The second paper analyzes the relationship between industry funding for research and bias in reported effectiveness and economic value of new drugs. Using a novel dataset of cancer drug trials and cost-effectiveness analyses, the author shows that studies sponsored by pharmaceutical \u00a0companies are significantly more likely to report favorable outcomes. The findings point to strong evidence of publication and modeling bias, with study design choices playing a major role in inflating perceived drug value. This paper underscores how financial interests can distort evidence generation, with implications for both clinical decision-making and drug pricing policy.The third paper explores conflicts of interest and industry influence in government advisory committees. It investigates whether financial ties between FDA advisory committee members and pharmaceutical companies influence voting behavior on these committees. Analyzing 21 years of meeting data and leveraging quasi-random variation in members\u2019 industry ties, the author finds that members with financial ties to a drug sponsor are significantly more likely to vote in favor of that sponsor. This effect is concentrated in votes on non-approval questions rather than drug approval questions. In contrast, ties to competitor firms do not affect voting, suggesting that conflicts of interest can be managed and expertise preserved by targeting restrictions on sponsor ties rather than prohibiting all industry relationships.The fourth paper examines the effect of medical board disciplinary actions on physicians found to have engaged in misconduct. Using a large dataset of state medical board activity, this study analyzes the impact of these disciplinary actions on the financial and professional trajectory of physicians. Disciplinary actions are followed by substantial declines in physicians\u2019 Medicare billings, loss of hospital affiliations, and shifts to smaller practice settings\u2014effects that are more pronounced for severe sanctions. This study finds that while most disciplined physicians remain in practice, state medical board actions may serve as a meaningful form of accountability, even in the absence of formal exclusion from public programs.These papers examine how financial and institutional incentives shape the behavior of experts in health care. Together, they highlight the tensions between expertise, accountability, and influence in systems where professionals hold informational advantage but face varying degrees of external scrutiny and regulation.Policy AreaHealth PolicySecondary Policy AreaPublic and Nonprofit Management and FinanceChairMireille Jacobson, University of Southern CaliforniaDiscussantAlice Chen, University of Southern CaliforniaOrganizerGenevieve P Kanter, University of Southern CaliforniaIndividual PresentationsThe Role of Physician Altruism in the Physician-Industry Relationship: Evidence from Linking Experimental and Observational Data - Presenting Author:  Jing Li, University of Washington; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Anirban Basu, University of Washington; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Shan Huang, Stockholm School of EconomicsSponsorship Effect and Publication Bias - Presenting Author:  Matthew Chenoweth, University of California - Los AngelesManaging Conflicts of Interest and Industry Influence in Government Advisory Committees: The Case of the FDA - Presenting Author:  Genevieve P Kanter, University of Southern CaliforniaFirst Do No Harm: The Labor Market Consequences of a Physician Disciplinary Record - Presenting Author:  Gabrielle Sorresso, Cornell University; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Amanda Yvonne Agan, Cornell University; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Colleen M Carey, Cornell University \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

They dictate the quality of school and other institutional meal programs funded by federal dollars and the low-cost food plan that meets the DGAs is at the core of SNAP benefit calculations. The 2020-2025 DGAs recommended that half of all grains consumed are whole grains. The Scientific Advisory Committee Report that provides input into the next (2025-2030) DGAs reiterates the importance of this recommendation to improve population health and reduce the prevalence of diet-related chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, stroke). Yet most Americans are consuming well-below these recommended amounts. Increasing intakes of whole grains requires new collaborations to build robust linkages across the value chain. This means crop, soil, and food scientists working on the development of nutritious varieties and healthy food products need to be working together with health and social science researchers focused on improving population health, nutrition, and diet quality.",

Using large-scale and innovative datasets, the four papers explore how minority and immigrant business owners drive economic dynamism, overcome structural barriers, and adapt to labor market and life-cycle constraints. Collectively, the findings offer fresh insights for considering immigration and economic development policy through the lens of entrepreneurship. Aligned with APPAM 2025's theme, \"Forging Collaborations for Transformative and Resilient Policy Solutions,\" the panel emphasizes the importance of combining academic research with policy insights to enhance support for underrepresented entrepreneurs, focusing on reducing disparities and leveraging the potential of immigrant and minority communities to strengthen local economies.",

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 5th Floor, 506 - SamishSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractInvestments in K-12 schools\u2019 human capital systems improve teacher quality and consistency, which in turn are principal determinants of student outcomes. Persistent teacher vacancies and threats to funding have sparked urgent discussions among education policymakers, state boards of education, and district administrators to find solutions to these systemic issues. Schools are seeking to hire, keep, and develop their pool of human resources with highly qualified instructors, and in sufficient numbers.\u00a0Policies that target the acquisition of human capital at schools, such as locally implemented federal turnaround initiatives and state-specific hiring strategies, are meant to expand the capacity of district personnel and school administrators to recruit and retain highly qualified teachers and school staff. However, evidence around the impact of these policy initiatives is mixed, particularly about affects on student achievement, teacher turnover and vacancies rates, and organizational efficiency.\u00a0\u00a0To move this literature forward, this panel brings together four papers that illuminate critical connections between improvement mandates and personnel challenges. Specifically, they highlight how school accountability policies affect human capital in targeted schools. The papers examine policies across three states, use varied methods, and comprise researchers from five different institutions.\u00a0The first paper examines the relationship between a Comprehensive School Improvement (CSI) designation and teacher vacancies on the school level. Merging multiple sets of school-level data in South Carolina and using a sharp regression discontinuity design, this study finds that the year after a school is designated as CSI there is an increase of 2.3 teacher vacancies.\u00a0\u00a0The second paper examines how district leaders in one school district developed and implemented an improvement initiative targeting (CSI) schools. Using policy documents and interview data from personnel and principals, this paper illuminates how district leaders used a principal replacement strategy to improve student achievement in the district\u2019s lowest performing school. Findings reveal considerations for managing dilemmas around organizational boundaries and hierarchies.\u00a0The third paper examines the effects of the Partnership Model \u2013 Michigan\u2019s strategy for supporting their lowest performing schools \u2013 on teacher turnover. Using a regression discontinuity design, this study finds that, in the first year of implementation, there are increases to within-district transfer but no effects on across-district transfer or on leaving Michigan public schoolsThe final paper in the panel explores the impacts of a novel teacher-leader policy in North Carolina on student test scores and teacher turnover. This study uses longitudinal statewide, student-level data and a difference-in-difference approach to shed light on how offering teachers increased leadership responsibility affects student and teacher outcomes.\u00a0This panel will explain the complexities of the educational labor market and discuss the relationship between accountability policies and human capital patterns in K-12 public schools. Findings indicate that increasing school accountability can increase the number of teachers or administrators transferring to other schools or teaching out of their field resulting in a sense of organizational entropy. However, when teachers are exposed to a targeted career development opportunity, students reap the rewards with increased academic achievement.Policy AreaEducationChairSamantha A Cullum, University of PennsylvaniaDiscussantsDavid S.

The papers use survey or administrative data to examine changes in outcomes over time among affected populations, relative to changes in the same outcomes for a comparison group unexposed to the policy in question.Policy AreaHealth PolicyChairJuan Agustin Echenique, New York UniversityDiscussantsPatrick Carlin, Washington State UniversityRafiuddin Najam, University of North Carolina, Chapel HillOrganizerMelissa Knox, University of WashingtonIndividual PresentationsFront-of-package food labeling policies and child nutrition: Evidence from Chile\u2019s comprehensive food policy reform - Presenting Author:  Agustina Laurito, University of Illinois, ChicagoThe Cook County Tax on Sweetened Beverages: The Purchase Impact of its Announcement, Implementation, and Repeal - Presenting Author:  John Cawley, Syracuse UniversityUsing Electronic Health Records to Estimate the Impact of Seattle\u2019s Sweetened Beverage Tax on Adult BMI - Presenting Author:  Melissa Knox, University of Washington \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

Together the four papers explore different areas of policy that are expected to have direct consequences from policy changes made by the Trump administration. From DEI policies in nonprofit organizations, federal civil service turnover, and changes in federal data websites to consideration of hazard mitigation assistance grants, the Trump administration's actions are far-reaching and have lasting effect. It is in this legislative environment that we reaffirm our commitment to scrutinizing how public\u2011administration theory and practice can confront\u2014and learn from\u2014the political forces now straining the limits of democracy, equity, and public trust. The distinct challenges posed by the Trump presidency call for an ongoing research and discussion on the duties and possibilities of researchers and public administrators.\u00a0Policy AreaPolitics, Media, and the Policy ProcessChairLauren Azevedo, U",

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 7th Floor, 706 - PilchuckSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractThe U.S. and many developed countries are facing rising economic inequality and declining mobility, with especially large inequality based on sex (Autor, Katz & Kearney, 2008; Chetty et al, 2020). This panel explores workers\u2019 career experiences, including factors that drive differences between women and men in labor market outcomes, such as employment, occupation, and earnings. The first paper provides evidence on how an individual\u2019s first job impacts their later-stage outcomes, and examines how wage growth varies within occupations for workers with different characteristics (e.g., sex and race). The second paper documents how non-pecuniary workplace preferences vary across gender and relate to choice of college major, occupation, and the early-career gender wage gap. The third paper develops a generalized occupational segregation index, estimates indexes on gender and educational attainment, and shows how occupational segregation compares across time and countries. The fourth paper provides an example from the education sector, investigating how the gender composition of superintendent hiring pools is related to the likelihood that a woman is hired. Together, these papers provide evidence on differences in labor market outcomes between women and men in a variety of contexts, including career stage, industry, and locality. They can help inform policy discussions around how to better support workers in the labor market and reduce inequities.Policy AreaEmployment and Training ProgramsSecondary Policy AreaEducationChairDaniel Sparks, University of ArkansasDiscussantsVeronica M.

The panel explores how laws, court decisions, and administrative practices can either mitigate or exacerbate violence and vulnerability, particularly among women, children, and marginalized gender groups.\u00a0Fantoni\u2019s mixed-methods study offers a rare view inside judicial decision-making on protective orders, revealing how legal outcomes vary in practice and perception. Campbell and Atkins' quasi-experimental analysis of state-level Hope Card initiatives evaluates whether innovations in protective order verification systems reduce IPV incidents. Durrance, Wang, and Wolfe assess the ripple effects of abortion restrictions post-Dobbs, linking diminished abortion access with increased IPV and child welfare involvement. Their work emphasizes the often-unseen consequences of reproductive policy on household dynamics and systemic interventions. Finally, Li and Fay offer a global perspective, assessing how national transgender protections influence IPV and sexual violence rates. Their findings point to positive spillover effects from trans-inclusive policies on broader population safety, while also complicating narratives about who benefits and how. By leveraging administrative data, legal analysis, policy variation, and cross-national comparisons, the panel advances conversations on how to build more responsive and inclusive policy solutions.Policy AreaCrime, Justice, and DrugsSecondary Policy AreaFamily and Child PolicyChairDanielle Atkins, Florida State UniversityDiscussantDaniel L Fay, Florida State UniversityOrganizerDanielle Atkins, Florida State UniversityIndividual PresentationsThe Undue Burden of Abortion Restrictions on  Relationship Violence and Child Welfare Involvement - Presenting Author:  Christine Piette Durrance, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Yang Wang; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Barbara L Wolfe; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Bilge Erten, Northeastern University; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Dhaval Dave, National Bureau of Economic ResearchA rising tide lifts all ships: Transgender protections and sexual violence outcomes across the globe - Presenting Author:  Mingxu Emma Li, Florida State University; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Daniel L Fay, Florida State UniversityDo judges get it right?

Whether you\u2019re involved in cross-sector coordination, co-located services, unified data systems, or any other partnership strategy that weaves supports together to meet community needs, this group is for you! Attendees will include practitioners, advocates, researchers, and policymakers. Key points of discussion will include: (1) practical challenges in implementing integrated services; (2) innovative strategies for human-centered programming; and (3) building sustainable cross-sector partnerships. The session will create opportunities for new connections and deliver actionable insights that attendees can apply to their work.Policy AreaAPPAM CommunitiesModeratorAllison D'Amour Meisch, James Bell AssociatesOrganizerMikaila Singleton, James Bell AssociatesSpeakerAllison Holmes, Annie E.

This assistance, which includes public housing and rental vouchers, serves only a fraction of eligible households\u2014but those that do succeed in accessing assistance typically receive deep subsidies that have no time limit and are not conditional on seeking or having employment. Recent proposals aim to change this paradigm; President Trump\u2019s administration has proposed a two-year cap on rental assistance for \u201cable-bodied adults\u201d and HUD is reportedly drafting a rule that would impose work requirements and time limits on the work-able adults it assists.",

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 6th Floor, 608 - WynocheeSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractThe demand for evidence of nonprofit social impact is at present a taken-for-granted assumption for the public policymakers and public managers who shape and oversee our public-private system of social service provision. Evaluation metrics are required elements of the government contracts that support many of the nonprofits serving individuals, families, and communities across the nation. The practice of nonprofit evaluation, however, is laden with challenges. Drawing on three book projects, this panel examines what goes wrong in the status quo of nonprofit evaluation and how we might do better. The first project examines the consequences of recent public policies that favor randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate nonprofit programs. It argues that RCTs are a poor match for the nonprofit context, as they undermine these organizations\u2019 core strengths of responsiveness and innovation. The second project identifies a central reason for the mismatch between standard evaluation approaches for nonprofit programs and the possibilities for social change strategies: the under-theorization of how much the relationships between nonprofit participants and organizational staff contributes to nonprofit social impact. Drawing on theory from sociology and social psychology, it demonstrates the importance of reshaping evaluation to account for nonprofit-participant relations if the impact of nonprofits is to be accurately captured. The third project moves the conversation further, showing how funders and community leaders struggle and sometimes succeed in reconciling standardized metrics with local adaptation and responsiveness.\u00a0Policy AreaPublic and Nonprofit Management and FinanceChairDavid F Suarez, University of WashingtonDiscussantMary Kay Gugerty, University of WashingtonOrganizerNicole Marwell, University of ChicagoIndividual PresentationsMismeasuring Impact: How Randomized Controlled Trials Threaten the Nonprofit Sector - Presenting Author:  Nicole Marwell, University of ChicagoHidden Impact: Taking Relationships Seriously When Evaluating Nonprofit Social Change - Presenting Author:  Lehn Marie Benjamin, Indiana UniversityDemocracy\u2019s Hidden Heroes - Presenting Author:  David C Campbell, American Society for Public AdministrationCollective Capacity Development for a Sustainable Nonprofit Sector: The Case of the Dream City - Presenting Author:  Emily Nwakpuda, University of Texas at Arlington \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

    "location": "Grand Hyatt Seattle, 1st Floor/Lobby Level, Leonesa 3Session Submission Type: PanelAbstractThe expansion of broad-based state merit aid programs represents one of the most significant financial aid trends of the past thirty years. Since Georgia launched HOPE Scholarships in 1993, over a dozen states have adopted large-scale college scholarship programs with eligibility based solely on student academic achievement. While researchers have extensively examined merit aid\u2019s effects on overall college attendance and choice, as well as student performance in high school and college, crucial gaps remain in our understanding of the medium- and long-term outcomes of these scholarships. Notably, there is relatively little research on how merit aid affects student outcomes in college, such as choice of major, persistence, and graduation, and how merit aid influences post-college outcomes, such as earnings and entrepreneurial activity. This panel addresses these gaps with three papers examining two of the largest state merit aid programs: Georgia\u2019s and Tennessee\u2019s HOPE Scholarship programs.",

Federal pandemic relief provided districts with temporary resources to invest in recovery efforts (Dewey et al., 2024), and many turned to tutoring to address student learning loss (Carbonari et al., 2022). This is in light of existing evidence that tutoring is the most effective approach to improving student learning outcomes (Kraft & Falken, 2021; Nickow et al., 2024; Kraft et al., 2024).

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 5th Floor, 504 - FossSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractA large body of literature has shown significant and multifaceted effects of teachers on students\u2019 cognitive and noncognitive outcomes, using value added models to estimate teachers\u2019 contributions to the education production function (Bacher-Hicks and Koedel, 2023). Moreover, a growing body of recent work documents significant effects of teacher value added on students\u2019 long-run outcomes including college enrollment and adult earnings (Chetty et al., 2014; Jackson, 2018; Gilraine and Pope, 2021; Petek and Pope, 2023; Backes et al., 2024). This panel provides new evidence on the long-run implications of access to teachers with high value added. The first three papers leverage longitudinal data linking K-12 student achievement with postsecondary outcomes to understand the persistent impacts of educational inputs during childhood, and the fourth paper complements these studies with evidence that teacher compensation policies can support high-quality teacher retention.\u00a0The first paper, by Hema Shah, studies the impacts of high school teachers on students\u2019 college admissions test scores and the subsequent implications for college enrollment and college performance. The author finds that students exposed to teachers with high value added on college admissions test scores are more likely to enroll in 4-year colleges. Exposure to teachers with high value added on college admissions test scores leads to increases in college GPA and completion and reductions in college dropout, conditional on whether and where students enroll in college. These results provide the first link between K-12 teacher value added and student performance in college coursework, suggesting that high school teachers have significant scope to influence the accumulation of college-relevant cognitive skillsThe second paper, by Ben Backes and James Cowan, proposes a new method to understand how teacher value added on various short-run outcomes contributes to students\u2019 long-run outcomes. The authors estimate combined value-added models which leverage both test and nontest measures of teacher value added to predict long-run student outcomes, including high school graduation and college enrollment. The authors find that combined value added models expand on the predictive power of traditional test-based value added measures.",

The first paper (Ballis) examines how immigrant peers affect U.S.-born students in Texas in the short- and long-run and sheds light on do native families adjust their schooling decisions in response to immigrant inflows, potentially reshaping both school composition and peer environments. The second paper (Brito) investigates how the influx of school-age Venezuelan refugees affects locals' educational outcomes in Northern Brazil and finds that immigrant students didn't seem to affect the retention, dropout, or exam performance of Brazilians. The third paper (Zaiour) examines how neighborhoods shape migrant parents' decisions to enroll their children in formal daycare in Denmark and shows that co-national networks reinforce traditional gender norms where refugees placed in neighborhoods with larger co-national networks are significantly less likely to enroll their children in formal childcare. Lastly, the fourth paper (de Lucena) studies whether sports can be a channel for improving natives\u2019 perception of migrants and finds that individuals from European countries with an over-achiever, high-immigrant national team, experienced an increase in positive feelings towards non-E.U. migrants post 2018 FIFA World Cup and provides evidence that this improvement in migrant perception is also connected to a decrease in discrimination as reported by ethnic minorities.Policy AreaPopulation and Migration IssuesDiscussantsJulia Li Zhu, San Diego State UniversityGiulia Olivero, Cornell UniversityOrganizerJulia Li Zhu, San Diego State UniversityIndividual PresentationsNative Flight and the Academic Consequences of Immigrant Peer Exposure - Presenting Author:  Briana Ballis, University of California, MercedThe Impact of Placement Exams on Refugee Children's School Enrollment - Presenting Author:  Carlos Brito, University of California, DavisCo-national Networks, Peer Effects, and the Use of Childcare among Refugees in Denmark - Presenting Author:  Reem Zaiour, Vanderbilt UniversityMigration and U.S. Labor Market Effects of the Mexican Drug War - Presenting Author:  Yuci Chen, W.

States bear the primary responsibility for certain programs (e.g., K-12 education), administer several federal programs (e.g., Medicaid, child care subsidies), and may choose to expand children\u2019s programming or benefits such as public preschool, paid family and medical leave programs, and tax credits, adding to geographic and time variability in public investments. An growing body of research indicates that state-level public spending and programs targeted to families and children improves their well-being and narrows inequalities in family investments and children\u2019s health and development (Averett & Wang, 2018; Flood et al., 2021; Goodman-Bacon, 2016; Jackson et al., 2022). However, how state policy variation, particularly in safety net programs, affects a range of child and family outcomes and across family types is not well-understood, and can be used to inform current policy debates.The four papers in this interdisciplinary panel offer multiple perspectives on how state variation in policymaking care needs and policies affect economic well-being across multiple generations. The authors use a variety of survey data and rigorous methods to draw policy-relevant conclusions, representing the fields of sociology, public policy, economics, and developmental psychology. In the first paper, Osborne and Haralampoudis examine how state policies and benefits change over time, and simulate several proposed changes to state policies in 2025. The next three papers exploit the increased safety net investments during the COVID-19 pandemic to examine how safety-net investments affect measures of material hardship. In the second paper, Goodman and colleagues use simulated state-level safety net program benefit levels over time (before and during the pandemic) to examine the effects of state generosity on food insecurity. Importantly, the authors attend to the different benefit types (e.g., cash vs. food assistance) and heterogeneity in effects of spending and programming. Hamilton and colleagues use a combination of survey and policy datasets and a simulated instrument to examine how pandemic relief programming affected material hardship among young adults. In the final paper, Jackson et al. use unique state-level data on public spending on programs related to children and families merged with the longitudinal survey data to examine how the totality of public investments during the pandemic relate to measures of family economic well-being (poverty, food insecurity, and income from transfer sources). Collectively, the findings from these studies will inform current policy debates about the state\u2019s role in supporting children and families.",

These different approaches, though distinct, work together to provide a more comprehensive and dynamic understanding of policy impacts, ultimately enriching the evidence base for decision-making at all levels of government.In addition to highlighting these advances, a central theme will be the challenge of capacity building\u2014many agencies and organizations continue to face limitations in technical expertise, staffing, and infrastructure that hinder their ability to effectively manage, analyze, and operationalize complex administrative data. Another growing struggle is the pressure on federal datasets stemming from falling budgets, declining staffing levels, and reduced survey response rates, which can pose challenges to maintaining the consistency and robustness of critical public data sources. Collaboration with academia and nonprofits can play a vital role in empowering government agencies to navigate these challenges, offering valuable support and innovative solutions that help bridge critical gaps. By tapping into the specialized knowledge, technological resources, and innovative approaches that external partners bring, agencies can enhance their data management capabilities, improve their analytical tools, and expand their ability to deliver more impactful services to citizens. Through promising initiatives and real-world case studies, speakers will illustrate how such partnerships have led to more effective outcomes, showcasing the value of cross-sector collaboration in driving better public policy.Policy AreaMethods and Tools of AnalysisSecondary Policy AreaPublic and Nonprofit Management and FinanceModeratorDidem Tuzemen, Coleridge InitiativeOrganizerDidem Tuzemen, Coleridge InitiativeSpeakersJake Walker, Arkansas Division of Information Systems-ARData TeamAhu Yildirmaz, Coleridge InitiativeEvan White, University of California, Berkeley \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

    "location": "Grand Hyatt Seattle, 1st Floor/Lobby Level, Princess 1Session Submission Type: PanelAbstractAlthough previous research has emphatically shown that workers experience stronger and more equitable wage growth when labor demand strengthens, such as when policymakers' actions contribute to a tight labor market, far less is known about how job quality changes, or the tradeoffs workers experience between wages and specific job amenities under changing labor market conditions. In large part, this lacuna is a result of few data sources jointly capturing wages, amenities, and changing labor demand in a way that allows estimation of causal relationships. This panel features three papers that use new data sources and methods to examine how workers value specific job amenities, relative to wages, and how tight labor markets can affect worker utility along margins beyond just wages. The first paper, \"Local Labor Market Tightness and Job Quality,\" uses novel data from the Federal Reserve Board's\u00a0Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) to estimate how multiple measures of local labor market tightness affects within-worker changes\u00a0in multiple dimensions of job quality, including finding the work interesting, work-life balance, opportunities for advancement, and perceived autonomy (as well as pay). Preliminary results show that a 10 percent increase in vacancies per capita is associated with a 12 percent increase in the likelihood of changing jobs and a 17.5 percent increase in the likelihood of moving to an overall better job. These results\u00a0suggest that labor market tightness not only improves worker pay, in line with earlier studies, but also several job amenities more broadly, and these effects vary across different groups of workers, with distributional consequences in overall worker wellbeing.The second paper, \"Job Amenities & Earnings Inequality,\" brings new techniques to bear in investigtaing the tradeoff between wages and job amenities (and shedding light on \"compensating wage differentials\"). Using a proxy variable approach for worker's total-compensation offer sets derived from utility theory, occupation-specific job amenities from O*Net, and detailed panel data of workers from multiple sources, the paper estimates the tradeoff frontier between wages and specific amneities for different contours of offer sets. The paper further shows that roughly two-thirds of the gender pay gap can be explained by the amenities inherent across different occupations, although differing amenities explain little of the wage inequality across race/ethnicity or socioeconomic background.The third paper, \"Will I Ever Be Satisfied? Job Quality and Unionization,\" studies how job quality relates to unionization efforts. Using data from both the NLRB and Glassdoor, the paper documents that establishments where job quality has declined (even within the same firm) are more likely to see unionization efforts, and this relationship is stronger for declines in work culture, management, and work-life balance than it is for pay. Thus suggests that poor job quality, even more than poor pay, precipitates unionization efforts. Moreover, although successful unionization reduces employee turnover (and pay), it does not lead to large improvements in job amenities.Policy AreaEmployment and Training ProgramsChairMichael Alexander Zabek, Federal Reserve BoardDiscussantsNatalia Emanuel, Federal Reserve Bank of New YorkMeredith Slopen, Stony Brook UniversityOrganizerBrad Hershbein, W.

Nagarajan and Brunjes show that the Trump administration\u2019s rollback of DEIA directives led to a surge in terminations for small and disadvantaged businesses, revealing how policy shifts redistribute risk and transaction costs. Boykin and Nam flip the narrative on year-end spending spikes, demonstrating that fourth-quarter disbursements can be an intentional equity lever that fuels job creation in women- and minority-owned firms. Grandia and Warsen trace Dutch youth-care contracts from award to implementation, finding that incomplete contracts force municipalities to juggle fiscal discipline, tailored services, and the mix of formal versus relational governance. Complementing these accounts, a study of state competitive-bidding thresholds shows that active judicial engagement accelerates the adoption of stricter bidding rules, underscoring courts as catalysts of institutional change in procurement. Taken together, the papers illuminate the persistent tension between efficiency and equity, showing how institutional design choices reverberate through contractor behavior, public service delivery, and socio-economic inclusion. Collectively, they call for a multi-level, interdisciplinary lens that treats procurement not as neutral administration but as contested policy arena where rules, values, and power intersect.Policy AreaPublic and Nonprofit Management and FinanceSecondary Policy AreaPolitics, Media, and the Policy ProcessChairBenjamin Manning Brunjes, University of WashingtonDiscussantLachezar G Anguelov, The Evergreen State CollegeOrganizerBenjamin Manning Brunjes, University of WashingtonIndividual PresentationsContract Terminations in Federal Procurement: Assessing the Disparate Effects on Small Disadvantaged Businesses - Presenting Author:  Srinithya Nagarajan, University of Washington; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Benjamin Manning Brunjes, University of WashingtonGovernment Waste or Win?

An efficient, effective, and responsive safety net can reduce economic inequality, support economic mobility, and stimulate economic growth. If targeted effectively, it can help children, families, and workers meet their needs and provide the greatest return on investment to enhance broader social welfare. In the face of rising economic inequality and potential federal cuts or restrictions, state and local policymakers have crucial decisions to make about how to target funds to address the needs of those in their communities. One paper considers the safety net broadly, examining inequality at the bottom of the income distribution.

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 5th Floor, 511 - Quinault BallroomSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractStructural determinants are the predecessors found further upstream from social determinants of health. Fundamental cause theory, the socio-ecological model, and other population health theories posit that some of the key inequities and disparities in sexual and reproductive health (e.g., pregnancy-related mortality and morbidity, disparate quality of care or coercion, or disparities in birth outcomes) are determined by systemic inequalities that permeate through local, state, and federal public policies that have bi-directional relationships with public opinion. Therefore, furthering the study and operationalization of the upstream\u2013the social and structural\u2013determinants of health requires deliberate attention. Moreover, the politicization of reproductive health care offers a crucial opportunity to study the structural levers that impact population health and well-being.\u00a0While three of the four papers study reproductive health or healthcare attitudes specifically, one paper approaches systemic issues affecting health coverage and health outcomes more broadly. Three of the four included studies offer perspectives on how diverging state policy landscapes relate to disparate health outcomes at the population level. Two of the four papers discuss social-economic policies, or safety net policies, as a particular policy lever that must be addressed in order to alleviate the health and healthcare burdens of the most historically disadvantaged populations. Three of the studies offer Medicaid as a particular policy area that states pursue for alleviating these burdens in particular. And one paper offers the crucial perspective of how public opinion on reproductive healthcare and public policy can be studied concurrently to understand these diverging policy landscapes. Together, these papers offer an essential multidimensional perspective on how social and structural determinants predict and can be manipulated to improve reproductive health outcomes, but also health and healthcare outcomes more broadly.Policy AreaHealth PolicySecondary Policy AreaFamily and Child PolicyChairAmelia Reese Masterson, University of California - Los AngelesDiscussantsNaomi Bethlehem Zewde, University of California - Los AngelesKellen A.

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 5th Floor, 501 - ChiwawaSession Submission Type: Late-Breaking RoundtableAbstractCongress passed H.R. 1 (also known as the \u201cOne Bill Beautiful Bill\u201d) on July 4, 2025. H.R. 1 expanded work requirements for those enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and instituted work requirements for the first time in Medicaid. By at least January 2027, work requirements will be imposed on Medicaid expansion adult enrollees 19 to 64. Starting this year, SNAP work requirements are expanding to those ages 55 to 65 and to participants responsible for caring for a dependent child aged 14 and above. The law also requires that states with higher SNAP error rates share the cost of benefits and reduces eligibility for certain noncitizens.As state agencies move toward operational changes, there are opportunities to better use current data systems to support HR1 compliance and exemption and mitigate negative impacts on Medicaid and SNAP enrollment. Through automated verification using \u2018ex-parte\u2019 processes and automated exemption for the medically frail, states could leverage already-existing data and systems to reduce the administrative burdens that their eligible populations must overcome to retain coverage. This roundtable will examine the evidence for how H.R. 1 is likely to impact SNAP and Medicaid by bringing together representatives from academia and two state agencies in Washington State to directly grapple with these challenges.The roundtable will address the following questions:What lessons can policymakers, researchers, and advocates draw from previous research and early efforts to respond to H.R. 1?How are states interpreting and planning to implement the new requirements?And what strategies are being used to reduce administrative burdens, ensure compliance, and mitigate potential coverage losses?Jeremy Barofsky (Associate Research Professor, Georgetown University, McCourt School of Public Policy, Better Government Lab) will serve as the roundtable moderator and provide policy background to ground the discussion, drawing on evidence from previous efforts to implement Medicaid work requirements and improvements in automated verification processes rolled out during Medicaid unwinding. Eric Giannella (Associate Research Professor, Georgetown University, McCourt School of Public Policy, Better Government Lab) will provide background on evidence on changes to SNAP, including the expansion of work requirements and SNAP error rates changes. We will have representatives from Washington State that will address their state\u2019s early responses to H.R. 1 in both Medicaid and SNAP. Trinity Wilson (Director of Medicaid Eligibility and Customer Service, Washington State Health Care Authority) and Carla Reyes (Assistant Secretary, Economic Services Administration) will explain how Washington State is preparing for changes to Medicaid and SNAP, respectively, and how these programs intend to work together. The roundtable will conclude by inviting audience members to participate and ask questions.Policy AreaPublic and Nonprofit Management and FinanceSecondary Policy AreaPoverty and Income PolicyModeratorJeremy Barofsky, Georgetown UniversityOrganizerJeremy Barofsky, Georgetown UniversitySpeakersEric Giannella, Georgetown UniversityCarla Reyes, Washington State Department of Social and Health ServicesTrinity Wilson, WA State Healthcare Authority \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

Across many developing, source countries, this has meant working with specific destination countries on expanding the economic opportunities to their growing youth population and their families for increased income and improved living standards. For the host countries largely dependent on the immigrant labor, however, this has also meant reforming policies to streamline the process of both migration and immigrant integration without a major political backlash.",

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 7th Floor, 706 - PilchuckSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractThe child support program in the United States is intended to ensure the financial well-being of the nearly 13 million children it serves. For many of the low-income families, its effectiveness often hinges on how they interact with the economic realities of the families they serve\u2014particularly low-income noncustodial parents. This panel brings together four papers that interrogate prevailing enforcement strategies, financial barriers to compliance, and opportunities for program innovation in state and federal child support systems. Drawing on administrative data, qualitative interviews, and mixed-methods assessments, the papers in this panel offer insight into how policy and practice can better account for the structural and individual circumstances shaping payment behavior and family outcomes.The first paper in the panel provides important context about the financial situation of parents who owe child support. Specifically, Berger, Cancian, and Chanda use novel linked credit and administrative data to investigate how consumer debt affects child support compliance among noncustodial parents. Understanding levels of debt among parents and its potential influence on child support payments underscores the financial situation for many parents who may go on to experience child support enforcement mechanisms.The next two papers focus on current use of\u00a0 enforcement tools and administrative leniency in enforcing orders during economic downturns. The first takes a mixed-methods approach to examine the use of civil contempt and license suspension as enforcement tools in one state. Administrative data and interviews with practitioners find uneven use and unclear outcomes, indicating an opportunity for tailored outreach that prioritizes family stability and economic opportunity. The second paper uses administrative data and county-level SNAP ABAWD waivers to examine whether the local economic context is considered when enforcing both SNAP requirements on ABAWDs and child support orders on NCPs. McDonald and Daniels argue that low-income adults simultaneously classified as ABAWDs and NCPs may experience compounding economic vulnerabilities and social exclusion, underscoring the importance of coordinated policy responses across related human services programs.\u00a0Finally, the fourth paper in the panel considers alternatives to current enforcement tools. Chen and colleagues share findings from assessments involving multiple stakeholders in 3 states. The assessments reveal common barriers\u2014such as ineffective communication, rigid enforcement mechanisms, and mismatches between policy intent and family realities; findings can inform actionable solutions grounded in stakeholder engagement and data analysis.Taken together, the papers in this panel illuminate the intersection between policy and complex financial lives of families served by the child support system. Findings indicate that collaboration among multiple stakeholders\u2013including families, local practitioners, and policymakers\u2013can help inform understanding of the economic situation of families and ultimately the potential for policy solutions grounded in evidence.Policy AreaFamily and Child PolicySecondary Policy AreaPoverty and Income PolicyChairCalaia Samara Ellice Jackson, University of DelawareDiscussantsAngela Guarin, Universidad de los AndesQuentin H Riser, University of Wisconsin-MadisonIndividual PresentationsImplications of Consumer Debt for Families Served by Child Support - Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Lawrence M.

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 6th Floor, 601 - HohSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractThe three papers in this panel present a range of perspectives on how universal school meal programs have affected student and community outcomes in the last decade. All papers utilize difference-in-differences research designs to estimate effects of various universal school meal programs, from the Community Eligibility Provision to COVID-era Universal Free Meal programs. Outcomes studied include student test scores and proficiency rates, absenteeism, high school graduation and dropout rates, and community crime levels and voting behavior on school district referenda. In paper 1, Rabinson Pahiju examines the effects on juvenile crime rates of the Community Eligibility Provision, which eliminates the need for individual families to complete applications for free or reduced-price meals at qualifying schools by verifying students\u2019 participation in other federal assistance programs. Preliminary results include that CEP adoption reduces county-level juvenile crime rates, especially for property crime. In paper 2, Meredith Dost also studies the effects of the Community Eligibility Provision, focusing on its staggered rollout in Wisconsin. The paper compares: 1) individual-level outcomes of economically disadvantaged students in schools that implemented the CEP versus similar students in schools that did not, and 2) district-level voting choices in school referenda measures on the ballot in districts that implemented the CEP compared with districts that did not. The author has recently gained access to this restricted dataset and analyses are underway. In paper 3, Garrison Pollard examines educational preparedness in Florida in the post-COVID era. The paper leverages a USDA policy that expanded school eligibility for universal free school meals to test how it affected student outcomes. Results show that those Florida schools which maintained free meals after these USDA waivers ended experienced positive effects on school reading and math proficiency rates, negative effects on chronic absenteeism in elementary schools, and that these effects were largest when the financial implications of participation are considered. Taken together, these papers explore how universal school meal policies affect the lives of students and their communities. Each of the papers has real-world implications for policies seeking to reduce child poverty and increase student achievement. Finally, the panel will benefit from the perspective of Dr. Sarah Charnes, serving as discussant, who is an expert on public food assistance in the U.S. and is currently studying school meal-related policy.Policy AreaPoverty and Income PolicySecondary Policy AreaEducationChairMeredith Dost, University of Wisconsin-MadisonDiscussantsSarah Charnes, WestatCaitlin Marie Lowery, University of Wisconsin-MadisonOrganizerMeredith Dost, University of Wisconsin-MadisonIndividual PresentationsUniversal Free School Meals and Juvenile Crimes: Evidence from Community Eligibility Provision - Presenting Author:  Rabinson Pahiju, The University of MemphisReducing Administrative Burden through Universal Free Lunch: Effects on Student Outcomes and Political Support for Schools - Presenting Author:  Meredith Dost, University of Wisconsin-MadisonUniversal Free Meals and the Distribution of Student Achievement in the Post-Pandemic Era - Presenting Author:  Garrison Pollard, University of FloridaFree School Lunches and Chronic Absenteeism in Oregon - Presenting Author:  Richard A Uhrig, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 5th Floor, 507 - SaukSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractThis panel examines the critical role that policy design, political structures, and institutional dynamics play in shaping energy-related processes and outcomes. As the urgency of the energy transition intensifies, understanding how public programs, political ideologies, and governance arrangements influence energy decisions becomes vital. The four papers in this panel highlight how political and policy environments condition shape who benefit from or bear the burdens of energy systems, and how energy transitions are interpreted, contested, and implemented at multiple levels of society.Catherine Chen and Aaron Strong investigate the decision-making barriers faced by low- and moderate-income (LMI) households when applying for energy efficiency programs in New York. Their study explores how policy tools can reduce cognitive decision costs and increase uptake of home energy upgrades under the EmPower+ program. By experimentally testing the effect of a simple, tailored decision tool, they reveal how policy design\u2014particularly the framing and accessibility of information\u2014can help mitigate structural inequities in access to energy-efficiency resources.Trevor Memmott and Michelle Graff examine how state-level politics shape patterns of energy insecurity for LGBTQ+ households. Using data from over two million respondents to the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey, they find that LGBTQ individuals are significantly more likely to experience energy-related hardship\u2014and that these disparities are exacerbated in states with more conservative political leadership and discriminatory policies. Their work underscores how political ideologies and social policy contexts can amplify energy vulnerability for already marginalized populations.Linlang He and Stephen Cottingham focus on the adoption of electric vehicles in municipal fleets, a key site of public-sector decarbonization. Drawing on original survey and interview data from Texas fleet managers, they reveal how budgetary constraints, institutional capacity, and operational priorities drive fleet electrification decisions more than sustainability goals. However, they also show that policy networks and external engagement can influence perceptions and willingness to adopt clean technologies, highlighting the role of inter-organizational relationships in shaping local energy transitions.Juniper Katz examines the tensions that arise within environmental advocacy coalitions as they navigate conflicts between renewable energy siting and conservation goals. Using the Advocacy Coalition Framework, she shows how differing beliefs and framing strategies lead to coalition realignments and policy stances in the face of \u201cgreen-on-green\u201d dilemmas. Her findings demonstrate how political coalitions and environmental narratives evolve in response to the complex trade-offs of the low-carbon transition.Together, these papers reveal how politics and policy do not merely set the stage for energy transition; they shape the very conditions under which change is possible, desirable, or contested. The panel emphasizes the need for adaptive, equity-focused policymaking that accounts for the diverse political, social, and institutional landscapes shaping energy outcomes.Policy AreaNatural Resource, Energy, and Environmental PolicySecondary Policy AreaPolitics, Media, and the Policy ProcessChairXue Gao, Florida State UniversityDiscussantsMallory E Flowers, University of Rhode IslandJoshua Basseches, Tulane UniversityOrganizerCatherine Chen, Hamilton CollegeIndividual PresentationsThe Beginning is Always the Hardest: Decision Costs of EmPower+ Application - Presenting Author:  Catherine Chen, Hamilton CollegeThe Political Geography of Energy Insecurity: Evidence from LGBTQ+ Households - Presenting Author:  Trevor Memmott, University of Massachusetts at Boston; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Michelle Graff, Georgia Institute of TechnologyElectric Vehicle Adoption in Municipal Fleets: Understanding Resources and Capacity through Performance Benchmarking - Presenting Author:  Linlang He, University of North TexasGreen Divide: Coalition Dynamics in the Low-Carbon Transition Movement - Presenting Author:  Juniper Katz, University of Massachusetts at Amherst \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

While financial aid helps offset college costs, administrative burdens, defined as frictions people encounter when trying to learn about and access government programs (Herd & Moynihan, 2019), prevent many eligible students from receiving aid (Kofoed, 2017; Page & Scott-Clayton, 2016). College costs coupled with administrative burdens create systemic barriers to college opportunity for low-income students (Rosinger, Meyer, & Wang, 2021). Some states have recognized financial aid application complexity undermines those programs\u2019 goals, and have advanced policies to smooth processes. In Washington state, recent legislation grants automatic eligibility for the state college grant based on SNAP receipt without needing to apply for financial aid. The legislation makes Washington the first state to link financial aid application and eligibility to receipt of SNAP and other food assistance programs. This policy streamlines the college-going process by letting lower-income students know early that they are eligible for free public college tuition.",

As a result, community colleges are often theorized to be more flexible and responsive to economic and policy shocks to align with labor market needs.

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 7th Floor, 701 - ClallumSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractHome equity accounts for the vast majority of most American households\u2019 wealth. However, the ability to purchase a home, build equity, and eventually access that equity is unevenly distributed across socioeconomic and demographic groups. This panel includes four empirical works assessing how homeowners from different life stages and backgrounds gain access to home equity in the United States. Furthermore, multiple studies on this panel move beyond exploring access to equity, but also consider whether drawing on home equity through different channels produces positive consumer outcomes.\u00a0First, Amorim and colleagues analyze Home Equity Investments (HEIs), a relatively new and unregulated financial product catering to consumers who may not be eligible for other, more established methods of accessing home equity. Using homeowners in Washington State as a case study, the study combines individual-level loan data drawn from tax records with interview data. Findings suggest HEIs are more common in disadvantaged neighborhoods, and that HEI consumers fall into two groups \u2013 those who are financially fluent and leverage the products to their advantage, and those without other options who may fall prey to unfavorable HEI terms.\u00a0Moulton and colleagues focus on Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC), and explores whether older adults who are potential HELOC borrowers would benefit from the access to additional equity, or suffer from the increased financial strain of loan repayment. Using records from over 100,000 HELOC applicants in Ohio between 2018 and 2022, the study specific a series of econometric models to conclude that older adults who exceeded the debt-to-income eligibility threshold set by lenders would have benefitted from access to a HELOC.\u00a0Meehan explores whether tenants\u2019 ability to purchase homes originally financed as affordable rentals via the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) can lead to home equity building. This study leverages data from over 405,000 Detroit properties between 2011 and 2024 to estimate appreciation in the markets surrounding LIHTC-funded homes. Findings indicate that purchasing these homes would have led to wealth building opportunities for former tenants. The study also provides an analysis of the programmatic and regulatory barriers that might have hindered this process.Finally, Haupert analyzes mortgage refinance application data to determine whether different types of mortgage lenders \u2013 specifically traditional brick-and-mortar lenders and online fintech lenders \u2013 display racial and ethnic disparities in their refinance lending patterns. The study econometrically analyzes over 11 million U.S. refinance loan application records between 2018-2020, finding that fintech lenders offer favorable outcomes, relative to traditional lenders, to Black and Latino applicants compared to similarly qualified White applicants. This effect is strongest for cash-out refinance loan applicants.\u00a0Collectively, these studies show that access to home equity is not equally distributed to households who could benefit from it. They also offer insights into the potential barriers that might make accessing and benefiting from home equity challenging. Results draw policymakers\u2019 attention to areas where home equity access can be expanded, but also point to key challenges that may arise along different paths to accessing that equity.Policy AreaHousing, Community Development, and Urban PolicySecondary Policy AreaSocial Equity and RaceChairAlec P.

This panel explores the conditions necessary to achieve equitable participation and access to energy resources, examining how current policies support\u2014or fail to support\u2014from three core dimensions of energy justice: procedural justice (first paper), recognition justice (second paper), and distributive justice (third and fourth papers). The four papers in the panel use a diverse range of methods to study the interplay between policy, participation, and impacts on marginalized communities across local and state jurisdictions in the U.S.The topics and implications of this panel closely align with the conference theme, Forging Collaborations for Transformative and Resilient Policy Solutions, by critically examining ongoing inequalities in the energy sector. Through the perspectives of diverse stakeholders\u2014including governments, project developers, local communities, utilities, and various social and demographic groups\u2014this panel underscores the importance of inclusive and comprehensive collaboration in addressing these challenges and provides information for future evidence-based policymaking.The first paper (Joohyun Ryu) examines the role of civic capacity in the siting of solar and wind farms across U.S. counties, employing spatial econometric models. The findings indicate that communities with greater access to human and financial resources tend to host smaller-scale power plants, both within their own jurisdictions and in neighboring areas. The second paper (S. Mohsen Fatemi) develops a comprehensive typology of state regulatory models across all 50 U.S. states, utilizing K-means clustering, statistical diagnostics, and machine learning techniques. This study identifies key factors influencing cluster membership, including clean energy ambition, state government ideology, and equity-oriented governance. The third paper (Aparajita Datta) analyzes the effects of welfare policies for energy consumption on racial minority groups using data from the 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey. The study finds that a low-income household energy assistance program does not lead to improvements in energy security and may perpetuate the marginalization of vulnerable populations. The fourth paper (Zhengyan Li and Shan Zhou) investigates how the impact of Renewable Portfolio Standards\u2014a regulatory state policy mandating a certain share of renewables in electricity generation\u2014varies across low-income and minority demographic groups.The contribution of this panel is broadening energy justice literature by uncovering underexplored and often overlooked sources of injustice. The findings demonstrate how policy design and implementation often overlook issues of injustice and reinforce historical inequities. while also highlighting the potential for more resilient and sustainable policy approaches in the ongoing transition toward a low-carbon energy system.Policy AreaNatural Resource, Energy, and Environmental PolicySecondary Policy AreaSocial Equity and RaceChairDestenie Nock, Carnegie Mellon UniversityDiscussantElizabeth Baldwin, University of ArizonaOrganizerJoohyun Ryu, University of ArizonaIndividual PresentationsRenewable Energy Siting in the US: How Civic Capacity and Diffusion Shape Energy Justice - Presenting Author:  Joohyun Ryu, University of ArizonaSetting the Stage for Energy Justice: Developing a State Regulatory Environment Typology for Utility Planning - Presenting Author:  Mohsen Fatemi, University of Kansas \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

So too are the forward-looking considerations of vulnerability to flooding, fire, heat etc. used by lenders, insurers, builders, credit rating agencies, and home buyers/renters. In response to the demand for investments that are protected against rising physical hazards, emerging risk management data products are becoming a more important part of decision and policy making.\u00a0 Such datasets on the risks from natural perils and weather-related disasters often claim to be able to protect future investments through information including peril-specific risk across the United States, future probabilities of hazards, and quantification of potential damages at the neighborhood and even parcel scales. Examples include public offerings like FEMA\u2019s National Risk Index and private data from firms such as Moody\u2019s and CoreLogic. The transparency, availability, and quality of these data impact decisions around resilience investments that can affect decades of public and private spending, built environment policy, and individual household financial planning. Financial sectors like the insurance industry already make use of such data and analyses show that premiums and non-renewal rates correlate with risks described in the indices. This is perhaps the best known and early price signal of the effect these data may be expected to have on markets. These new high-resolution physical risk datasets have considerable nuance in their varied underlying data and unexplored future uses. \u00a0Given this, we propose a roundtable discussion to better understand the design of these data, their most appropriate applications, potential pitfalls, and use in research.",

This analysis will center on the causal role of school quality and neighborhood effects on generational mobility processes. That is, this paper will focus attention on how Black and White families with identical household incomes tend to reside in very different neighborhoods with considerable divergence in available resources and the role this plays in undermining racial economic income convergence.\u00a0Picking up on this thread, Genevieve Siegel-Hawley highlights the role of housing policy and the stakeholders who implement it in preserving or reducing resource imbalances across neighborhoods. This paper presents the development of an affluent planned community that reinforced segregation in a major southern suburban school district as a case study of how development patterns shape and are shaped by school policy. This study will draw on publicly available qualitative data as well as 15-20 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders to investigate how suburban land use, planning, and development processes intersect with and influence school construction and rezoning. Given bipartisan support for addressing the nationwide housing shortage, these results will help inform development policies that can prevent further segregation and instead advance racially and economically diverse schools and neighborhoods.",

Likewise, widespread reports of America\u2019s child care crisis creating substantial obstacles in day-to-day life and planning for families permeate the news and the early childhood education (ECE) field. Issues related to long waitlists, high costs, and child care deserts mount as the demand for quality child care continues to exceed the supply. Despite national attention, the ECE literature has not kept pace in examining infant and toddler child care. Little is known about program characteristics concerning families\u2019 preferences, the implications of preschool expansion, and decision-making processes at child care programs. The present panel addresses these research questions by centering on center based ECE programs licensed to serve infants and toddlers amidst a changing policy landscape.",

    "location": "Grand Hyatt Seattle, 1st Floor/Lobby Level, Portland BSession Submission Type: RoundtableAbstractBehavioral science has increasingly recognized the importance of translating research into real-world impact. Traditionally, this involves external consultants or academic researchers developing interventions and then handing them off to implementing organizations. However, there is growing evidence that embedding behavioral design teams directly within organizations can lead to more effective and sustainable outcomes. This roundtable will argue that we have an opportunity to have even greater impact by leveraging a whole-of-institution approach that lets us intervene in deeper and more impactful ways, as a complement to or in place of smaller demonstration projects (\u201cnudges\u201d). Speakers will explore the benefits and challenges of this embedded approach, drawing on practical experiences and empirical evidence.",

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 5th Floor, 509 - ToltSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractVision loss is associated with falls and hip fractures, difficulties in performing the activities of daily living, social isolation and loneliness, depression, cognitive impairment, and increased mortality. Most vision loss can be corrected with an up-to-date prescription for corrective lenses, but many adults do not have routine vision coverage. In a recent KFF poll, one-quarter of adults reported delaying or going without vision services due to cost.Routine eye exams and glasses are an optional adult benefit in state Medicaid programs. Previous research demonstrates that when states provide these benefits, Medicaid-enrolled adults are more likely to visit the eye doctor and experience improvements in vision. However, literature to date has focused on younger adults under age 65 without dual Medicare enrollment and has largely remained silent on health outcomes beyond vision. Moreover,\u00a0there is no comprehensive longitudinal database describing state-level routine vision benefits. The lack of reliable state-by-year level data limits research on the effect of vision benefits on outcomes and the role that vision benefits play as a financial lever that is used by states to manage their Medicaid programs.In this session, we present new evidence on the association between Medicaid routine vision benefits and health outcomes among dual Medicare and Medicaid enrolled adults. We examine the association between North Carolina's January 2019 addition of routine eye exams and glasses coverage and fall-related inpatient and emergency department discharges. We also examine the association between routine vision benefits and eye care access, out-of-pocket spending, and recent diagnoses of systemic health problems that can be identified durign an eye exam using national data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. Finally, we present a new longitudinal policy database that documents state-level policies from 2000-2023 and highlight its features in an application to the National Health Interview Survey.Policy AreaHealth PolicyChairAja Kennedy, Tufts UniversityDiscussantXuechao (Jane) Qian, Ball State UniversityOrganizerBrandy Lipton, University of California IrvineIndividual PresentationsImpacts of Medicaid Vision Coverage on Eye Care Use, Out-of-Pocket Spending, and Diagnoses Among Duals - Presenting Author:  Brandy Lipton, University of California IrvineA Longitudinal Database of Medicaid Routine Vision Coverage Policies, 2000-2023 - Presenting Author:  Michel H.

Public service is understood not just as designing policies or performing administrative tasks; it is fundamentally about promoting collective well-being and upholding the principles of social equity, justice, and inclusion. This gathering aims to create a community of practice that brings together practitioners, scholars, and students of public policy and administration who are committed to (and/or curious to learn more about) advancing social equity and justice through trauma-informed, repair- and healing-focused approaches. The intention is to foster a space for community building, sharing reflections on rewards, challenges, and opportunities, exchanging ideas, innovations, and promising strategies aimed at developing a trauma-informed, repair-and-healing-oriented public service in service of deeper social equity and justice-focused change.

Participants share a common interest in how data can be ethically and effectively leveraged to understand and support human development across linguistically, culturally, and geographically diverse populations. The conversation will center around four key themes: 1) Building and sustaining cross-sector data infrastructures in decentralized, multi-jurisdictional systems; 2) Ethical frameworks for data sharing, ownership, and AI-based analysis in Indigenous and historically marginalized communities; 3) Applications of federated learning, predictive modeling, and open-source tools for child and family policy; 4) Regional coordination opportunities for trans-Pacific collaboration on early childhood, education, and health data system. This gathering is designed as an informal, generative space for scholars and technical experts who often work in isolation due to geographic and institutional divides. By connecting across shared challenges\u2014such as limited interoperability, cultural data sovereignty, and capacity constraints\u2014we aim to seed a new network dedicated to Pacific-facing human development data science.Policy AreaAPPAM CommunitiesOrganizerRemy Pages, State of Hawaii - Exc.

Since Spring 2025, SSA has cut staff at every level, halving headquarters staff and nearly eliminating regional office staff. Frequently changing and compounding restrictions on access to SSA services have created significant barriers to disabled claimants and beneficiaries seeking to access and maintain critical benefits. In March, SSA required beneficiaries to make certain changes to their accounts in person at field offices while issuing policies to dramatically curtail walk-in assistance. SSA increased the beneficiary overpayment repayment rate cap from 10% to 100% of an individual\u2019s monthly benefit in March, and then changed it again to 50% in April following widespread public pressure. Through the summer of 2025, SSA rolled out a new phone system that introduced an AI chatbot, changed all staff extensions, rerouted callers to offices that could not address their case, further complicating access.",

The program supports over 2.3 million households each year, and has been shown to provide numerous benefits, including reducing rent burdens, homelessness, and overcrowding. However, the program still faces several challenges, including a complex take-up process, difficulty in helping households move to a broad set of neighborhoods, and increasing costs. The four papers in this panel examine different components of the program\u2019s design, administration, and implementation, from program take-up through program exit, to help understand where the program may fall short and what factors can help the program be most effective.",

The first paper discusses how improved local access to mental health facilities leads to a reduction in mortality rates associated with mental health and behavioral disorders. The paper estimates indicate that a 10% increase in facilities lowers a county's mental health and behavioral disorders rate by 2%.The second paper examines the effects of hospital closures on the financial performance of nearby hospitals, differentiating outcomes based on ownership type. Tracking over 5,000 hospitals nationwide from 2011 to 2019, the study finds that for-profit neighboring hospitals capitalize on reduced competition by increasing their charge-to-cost ratios by nearly 200% and net profit margins by 6.1%, reflecting a profit-maximizing strategy. Nonprofit hospitals also experience financial benefits, though to a lesser extent, while governmental hospitals show minimal or negative financial impacts.The third paper analyzes trends in CEO compensation across nonprofit and for-profit healthcare systems. By utilizing compensation data from the nonprofit hospital Form 990s and proxy statements from publicly traded for-profit health systems, the study reveals that base salaries for the largest for-profit systems increased by 2.6%, while base salaries for a matched sample of nonprofit systems grew by 15.1%.Policy AreaHealth PolicySecondary Policy AreaMethods and Tools of AnalysisDiscussantAshley Bradford, Georgia Institute of TechnologyOrganizerSalpy Kanimian, Rice UniversityIndividual PresentationsHealth Effects of Local and Geographic Access to Mental Health Treatment Facilities - Presenting Author:  Olanrewaju Yusuff, Georgia State UniversityRipple Effects: The Impact of Neighboring Hospital Closures on Charges and Profitability Across Ownership Types - Presenting Author:  Salpy Kanimian, Rice UniversityCompensation for Hospital CEOs: Trends and Incentive Structures in Nonprofit vs. For-Profit Systems - Presenting Author:  Derek Jenkins, Rice UniversityThe Growth in Stand Alone Emergency Departments in Texas and their Impact on Hospital Operations - Presenting Author:  Benjamin Ukert, Texas A&M University \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 5th Floor, 504 - FossSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractA growing literature examines the return to college major, showing large differences in labor market outcomes based on one\u2019s field of study. However, the courses one takes to complete a major represent a minority of courses taken in college. Are the returns to college major the dominant way through which courses translate into labor market returns, or are there returns more broadly to different courses students take in college?\u00a0The answer to this question has much policy relevance. For institutional leaders, it is essential to understand the labor market value of different courses in order to be able to focus resources on areas that best support student labor market outcomes. From a student perspective, information on where the returns are highest to different courses is important to maximizing the value of their higher education investment. As well, the returns to non-major coursework are important to understand in order to develop regulations around the number of courses students need to take to obtain a degree. This panel contains four papers that provide new evidence on this important question. Three of the papers use new administrative data from Texas that contains the courses each student takes linked to their pre-collegiate K-12 records and their subsequent labor market outcomes. Two of these papers explore different dimensions of course-level returns in the four-year sector, while another examines this question in the two-year sector. The fourth paper estimates the value of a liberal arts education specifically, using merged transcript data from seven public, four-year universities. Together, these papers provide the most comprehensive picture to date on the value of college coursework, to the skills students learn in different classes, and to the return to a liberal arts education.Policy AreaEducationChairMichael Lovenheim, Cornell UniversityDiscussantZachary Bleemer, Princeton UniversityIndividual PresentationsThe Return to College Coursework - Presenting Author:  Scott Imberman, Michigan State UniversityDoes Coursework Matter?

    "location": "Hyatt Regency Seattle, 5th Floor, 507 - SaukSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractThe transportation sector is experiencing rapid technological change toward low-carbon emissions through electrification. However, a successful transition faces increasing pressure from tariffs, competition, and regulation. In response, governments have introduced a range of policies to support domestic battery industries, accelerate EV adoption, and expand public charging networks. However, those efforts often failed to achieve the long-term stability needed for innovation and adoption. This panel brings together four papers that rethink the elements of transformative and resilient policy designs. The first paper uses patent citation network analysis to understand knowledge flows within the EV battery technology\u00a0to extract insights on effective targeting of\u00a0domestic industrial policies. The second paper investigates the effects of a broad portfolio of policy instruments, such as performance standards and R&D grants, on cross-national, firm-level EV-related innovations. The third paper uncovers how within-industry and cross-industry competition can have opposing effects on the operational reliability of EV charging infrastructure as a supplementary service, and describes how existing policy might fail to reach the communities most in need of quality improvement and maintenance. The fourth paper investigates the effect of US EV subsidies and trade policies on short-term and long-term changes in the volume of automobiles manufactured, electric vehicle sales, and consumer and manufacturer welfare across countries. This panel brings together different disciplinary perspectives from economics, policy analysis, public administration, environmental management, and engineering systems. The authors deploy a range of methods and theoretical perspectives to complement analyses of high-resolution datasets from patents to economic data to machine learning predictions. The authors represent institutional diversity, gender balance, and a mix of early-career and senior scholars.Policy AreaNatural Resource, Energy, and Environmental PolicySecondary Policy AreaInnovations in Science and TechnologyChairOmar Isaac Asensio, Georgia Institute of TechnologyDiscussantsFang Zhang, Tsinghua UniversityChang Wang, University of Michigan Ann ArborOrganizerYifan Liu, Georgia Institute of TechnologyIndividual PresentationsTechnology-smart industrial policy for batteries: Insights from intra-technology knowledge flow analysis - Presenting Author:  Anurag Panda, ETH Zurich; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Andr\u00e9 Hemmelder; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Tobias S Schmidt, ETH ZurichDriving Innovation: The Policy Tools Powering Electric Vehicle Technological Inventions - Presenting Author:  Jingni Zhang, Syracuse University; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  David C.

Using diverse analytical approaches, including quasi-experimental methods, large-scale survey data, and analyses of user-generated online content, the three papers offer new evidence and tools for addressing the challenges of food insecurity, program design, and administrative burden.The first paper examines the impact of SNAP Emergency Allotment (EA) expiration on food insufficiency among households with children, highlighting vulnerable subgroups disproportionately affected by benefit cuts. The second paper utilizes user-generated content on Reddit to explore the lived experiences of SNAP applicants and beneficiaries, providing real-time insights into administrative burdens and procedural challenges. The third paper investigates the expansion of online grocery purchasing for SNAP and related food assistance programs, showing that greater access to digital transactions enhances program use and reduces redemption barriers.Collectively, these presentations highlight the evolving nature of SNAP and its central role in the U.S. safety net. The panel underscores the importance of designing programs that are effective and equitable, while also responsive to the economic, technological, and administrative realities faced by low-income households, grounded in structured policy analysis, empirical evidence, and lived experience.Policy AreaPoverty and Income PolicySecondary Policy AreaPolitics, Media, and the Policy ProcessChairMichele Ver Ploeg, George Washington UniversityDiscussantsEllyn Terry, University of WashingtonLiwei Zhang, The University of GeorgiaOrganizerElora Choudhury, University of Michigan Ann ArborIndividual PresentationsFood Insufficiency After SNAP Emergency Allotment Expiration: Evidence from Households with Children - Presenting Author:  Ruijie Ma, University of PittsburghUnderstanding Administrative Burdens and Experiences of Social Program Beneficiaries and Applicants Using Posts on Reddit - Presenting Author:  Michiko Ueda, Syracuse University; Non-Presenting Co-Author:  Colleen M Heflin, Syracuse UniversityFrom Storefronts to Screens: The Impacts of Online Grocery Shopping on Public Food Assistance Users - Presenting Author:  Kelsey Pukelis, Harvard University & California Department of Social Services \u00a92025 All Academic, Inc. \u00a0 | \u00a0 Privacy PolicyDirect link:Tweet",

Perhaps reflecting its importance, three-quarters of Californians say they favor increasing government funding to improve child care access for lower-income working parents (Baldassare et al. 2024). \u00a0However, facilities and staffing are constraints on expanding a mixed delivery system to meet the diverse needs of families. This panel examines these topics from multiple perspectives, analyzing both aggregate administrative and qualitative data. We focus on California, which has nearly tripled spending on ECE over the past decade as it implements its 2020 Master Plan for Early Learning and Care. Our policy-focused research promises to help the state achieve its goals.",

    "location": "Grand Hyatt Seattle, 1st Floor/Lobby Level, Discovery BSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractThe current homeschool population is estimated at around 6% of the total K-12 US population. When compared to around 7% in charter schools and 9-10% in private schools, the importance of the population becomes evident. Similarly, these are single-point-in-time estimates that do not capture American families who have ever homeschooled a child. Yet, despite the size and recent growth of this population, current information on homeschool sector participation and motivation is limited. Further, the recent decline in available federal data that captures information on this population limits new knowledge about this group. Additionally, as education savings accounts (ESAs) and other public funding programs expand across the country, little is known about how this funding will impact the homeschool community. In some states, homeschoolers are eligible for funding, in others they are not, and in still others they receive a discounted rate. In some states, homeschool advocates campaigned against these funding programs on behalf of homeschoolers in their states. In others, they welcomed these new programs.\u00a0This panel will consider factors that may influence today's homeschooling patterns, from current participation trends, to potential motivation and contributing factors such as increases in public funding for which homeschooling families may be eligible. Similarly, these new programs may offer flexibility for families who choose homeschool adjacent models such as hybrid schools, microschools, and other innovative emerging options.\u00a0Experts and practitioners discuss current trends, the state of public funding available to homeschooling families, some of the issues around that funding, and the innovative trends currently emerging in this space.Policy AreaEducationChairAngela Watson, Johns Hopkins UniversityDiscussantDavid Hunt, Aristotle Foundation for Public PolicyOrganizerAngela Watson, Johns Hopkins UniversityIndividual PresentationsAre Public Education Resources Available to Homeschoolers? - Presenting Author:  Christy Batts, North Carolina State University\u2018Trojan Horse\u2019 or \u2018Freedom to Choose\u2019?

Equitable evaluation that includes those served is a natural way for governments to more intentionally center equity in practice.

    "location": "Grand Hyatt Seattle, 1st Floor/Lobby Level, EA AmphitheaterSession Submission Type: PanelAbstractPeople experience government through their personal interactions with public programs and policies. Stigmatizing interactions, for example, may negatively impact future interactions and program take-up. Recent work underscores how administrative burdens shape citizen-state interactions by imposing learning, compliance, and psychological costs (Herd & Moynihan, 2019). While some burdens are experienced by clients directly, street-level bureaucrats often act as \u201cultimate policy makers\u201d by administering benefits or mediating citizen-state interactions (Lipsky, 1980). Administrative burden research has focused on \u2018burden tolerance\u2019 to understand street-level bureaucrats\u2019 behavior and perceptions to support people who are experiencing difficulty in citizen-state interactions. While we now have some understanding of the factors that shape burden tolerance, such as political ideology (Bell et al., 2021), personality (Aar\u00f8e et al., 2021), and the deservingness of clients (Baekgaard et al., 2021), there is still limited research on the effects of institutional and managerial factors. Additionally, we are uncertain about how street-level bureaucrats actually behave in practice to alleviate the burdens of clients, and how clients respond to these efforts.",

When state and local governments bring together information from across agency silos, they are better equipped to understand the complex needs of individuals, allocate resources to improve services equitably, measure impacts of programs holistically, and engage in transparent, shared decision-making about how data should and should not be used. Data sharing and integration is also not without risks, including risks related to individual privacy and risks of bias and oversurveillance at the community or systems level.\u00a0 Despite diverse contexts, efforts that seek to leverage integrated data to improve individual and population outcomes face common ethical, relational, legal, and technical considerations.",
